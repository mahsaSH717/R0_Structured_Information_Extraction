Actualmente la epidemia COVID-19 se est'a desarrollando en la Ciudad de Culiac'an Sinaloa, México, donde hasta el 20 de abril del presente ano han ocurrido 35 decesos asociados con esta epidemia. El n'umero de reproducci'on $(R_0)$ de una epidemia representa el n'umero promedio de personas contagiadas por una persona infectada durante su periodo de infecci'on. En este trabajo usamos los datos publicados por la Secretaria de Salud del Estado de Sinaloa sobre el n'umero de nuevos casos infectados confirmados por dia y estimamos que el valor de $R_0$ es de 1.562 con un intervalo del 95% de confianza dado por (1.401,1.742).

The spread of SARS-CoV-2 created a pandemic crisis with > 150,000 cumulative cases in > 65 countries within a few months. The reproductive number (R) is a metric to estimate the transmission of a pathogen during an outbreak. Preliminary published estimates were based on the initial outbreak in China. Whole genome sequences analysis found mutational variations in the viral genome; however, previous comparisons failed to show a direct relationship between viral genome diversity, transmission, and the epidemic severity. COVID-19 incidences from different countries were modeled over the epidemic curve. Estimates of the instantaneous R (Wallinga and Teunis method) with a short and standard serial interval were done. WGS were used to determine the populations genomic variation and that underpinned creation of the pathogen genome identity score, which was merged with the outbreak curve in four distinct phases. Inference of transmission time was based on a mutation rate of 2 mutations/month. R estimates revealed differences in the transmission and variable infection dynamics between and within outbreak progression for each country examined. Outside China, our R estimates observed propagating dynamics indicating that other countries were poised to move to the takeoff and exponential stages. Population density and local temperatures had no clear relationship to the outbreak progression. Integrating incidence data with the GENI score directly predicted increases in cases as the genome variation increased that led to new variants.
