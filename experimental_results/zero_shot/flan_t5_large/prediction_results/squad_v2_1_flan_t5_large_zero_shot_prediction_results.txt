El n'umero de reproducción $(R_0) de una epidemia representa el n'umero promedio de personas contagiadas por una persona infectada durante su periodo de infeccion. En este trabajo usamos los datos publicados por la Secretaria de Salud del Estado de Sinaloa sobre el n'umero de nuevos casos infectados confirmados por da y estimamos que el valor de $R_0$ es de 1.562 con un intervalo del 95% de confianza dado por (1.401,1.742).

METHODS: The SEIR model is a mathematical model of the spread of COVID-19. The model is based on the following parameters: the incubation period = 3.7 days, the proportion of critical cases = 0.05, the overall case-fatality rate = 0.023, and the asymptomatic proportion of COVID-19 = 0.18. The critical step in the prediction of COVID-19 by the model is the value of R0 (the basic reproduction number) and T_infectious (the infectious period, in days). R0 and T_infectious for each phase of the curve are calculated by mathematical constrained optimization, a numerical method. Different from a statistical modelling, a numerical method is a type of mathematical modelling that is not dependent on a probability distribution. The objective function that measures the model error is minimized with respect to R0 and T_infectious in the presence of constraints on those variables. For R0, constraints are valid range of values (0.5 â€° R0 â€° 20). For T_infectious, constraints also are related to its range of values (2 â€° T_infectious â€° 14). A Solver from Excel or NEOS Server, for example, can be used for finding numerically minimum of a function Z, that represents the sum of absolute value of errors between COVID-19 new cases observed in one day, and COVID-19 cases predicted by the SEIR model (Fig. 2 and 3).

OBJECTIVES: To estimate the day-zero of the COVID-19 outbreak in Lombardy, Italy, we propose a modified compartmental model with two compartments of infectious persons: one modelling the cases in the population that are asymptomatic or experience very mild symptoms and another modelling the infected cases with mild to severe symptoms. The parameters of the model corresponding to the recovery period, the time from the onset of symptoms to death and the time from exposure to the time that an individual starts to be infectious, have been set as reported from clinical studies on COVID-19. For the estimation of the day-zero of the outbreak in Lombardy, as well as of the "effective" per-day transmission rate for which no clinical data are available, we have used the proposed SEIIRD simulator.

BACKGROUND: Mathematical modeling of virus dynamics has provided quantitative insights into viral infections such as influenza, the simian immunodeficiency virus/human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C. Through modeling, we can estimate the half-life of infected cells, the exponential growth rate, and the basic reproduction number (R(0)). To calculate R(0) from virus load data, the death rate of productively infected cells is required. This can be readily estimated from treatment data collected during the chronic phase, but is difficult to determine from acute infection data.
