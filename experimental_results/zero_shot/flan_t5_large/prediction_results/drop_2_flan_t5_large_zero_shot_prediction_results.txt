Actualmente la epidemia COVID-19 se está desarrollando en la Ciudad de Culiac'an Sinaloa, México, donde hasta el 20 de abril del presente ao ha ocurrido 35 decesos asociados con esta epidemia. El n'umero de reproducción $(R_0) de una epidemia representa el n'umero promedio de personas contagiadas por una persona infectada durante su periodo de infeccion. En este trabajo usamos los datos publicados por la Secretaria de Salud del Estado de Sinaloa sobre el n'umero de nuevos casos infectados confirmados por da y estimamos que el valor de $R_0$ es de 1.562 con un intervalo del 95% de confianza dado por (1.401,1.742).

Simultaneously controlling COVID-19 epidemics and limiting economic and societal impacts presents a difficult challenge, especially with limited public health budgets. Testing, contact tracing, and isolating/quarantining is a key strategy that has been used to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. However, manual contact tracing is a time-consuming process and as case numbers increase it takes longer to reach each cases' contacts, leading to additional virus spread. Delays between symptom onset and being tested (and receiving results), and a low fraction of symptomatic cases being tested can also reduce the impact of contact tracing on transmission. We examined the relationship between cases, delays, and participation and the pathogen reproductive number Rt. We also examined implications for infection dynamics using a stochastic compartment model of SARS-CoV-2. We found that Rt increases sigmoidally with the number of cases due to decreasing contact tracing efficacy. This relationship results in accelerating epidemics because Rt increases, rather than declines, as infections increase. Shifting contact tracers from locations with high and low case burdens relative to capacity to locations with intermediate case burdens maximizes their impact in reducing Rt (but minimizing total infections is more complicated). Finally, we found that when cases are low, testing and tracing reductions in Rt can sometimes greatly delay epidemics due to the highly heterogeneous transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2, in which a small fraction of infections often give rise to most of transmission. These results demonstrate the importance of having an expandable or mobile team of contact tracers that can be used to control surges in cases. They also emphasize the value of easy access, high testing capacity and rapid turn-around of testing results, as well as outreach efforts to encourage symptomatic infections to be tested immediately after symptom onset. An efficient and adaptive public health capacity strategy can allow for increased economic activity and should be employed in the current and future pan-SARS pandemic.
