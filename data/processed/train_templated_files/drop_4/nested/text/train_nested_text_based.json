We implement an SEIR model to analyze the disease evolution in Buenos Aires and neighboring cities. The model parameters are calibrated using the number of casualties officially reported. Since infinite solutions honor the data, we show different cases. In all of them the reproduction ratio R0 decreases after early lockdown, but then raises, probably due to an increase in the community circulation of the virus. Therefore it is mandatory to reverse this growing trend in R0 by applying control strategies to avoid a high number of infectious and dead individuals. The model provides an effective procedure to estimate epidemic parameters (fatality rate, transmission probability, and infection and incubation periods) and monitor control measures during the epidemic evolution. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021.

As a measure of transmissibility, we aimed to estimate concurrently the time-varying reproduction number, R0(t), over time during the COVID-19 pandemic for each of the following 12 heavily-attacked countries: Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Belgium, United Kingdom, the United States of America, and South Africa. Methods: We downloaded the publicly available COVID-19 pandemic data from the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard website (https://covid19.who.int/) for the duration of January 11, 2020 and May 1, 2020. Then, we specified two plausible distributions of serial interval to apply the novel estimation method implemented in the incidence and EpiEstim packages to the data of daily new confirmed cases for robustly estimating R0(t) in the R software. Results: We plotted the epidemic curves of daily new confirmed cases for the 12 selected countries. A clear peak of the epidemic curve appeared in 10 of the 12 selected countries at various time points, and then the epidemic curve declined gradually. However, the United States of America and South Africa happened to have two or more peaks and their epidemic curves either reached a plateau or still climbed up. Almost all curves of the estimated R0(t) monotonically went down to be less than or close to 1.0 up to April 30, 2020 except Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Iran, and South Africa, of which the curves surprisingly went up and down at various time periods during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, the United States of America and South Africa were the two countries with the approximate R0(t) [\u00e2\u2030\u00a5] 1.0 at the end of April, and thus they were now facing the harshest battles against the coronavirus among the 12 selected countries. By contrast, Spain, Germany, and France with smaller values of the estimated R0(t) were relatively better than the other 9 countries. Conclusion: Seeing the estimated R0(t) going downhill speedily is more informative than looking for the drops in the daily number of new confirmed cases during an ongoing epidemic of infectious disease. We urge public health authorities and scientists to estimate R0(t) routinely during an epidemic of infectious disease and to report R0(t) daily to the public until the end of the epidemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Health issues and population safety have driven countries' economies to a critical state;therefore, sustaining economic activity while keeping workers safe has become a worldwide goal. In this paper, we present a novel safety protocol based on rapid antibody testing (ABT). Using discrete event simulation, we evaluated its performance on the cumulative number of infected workers, effective reproductive number ($R_e$), and active work force within a company. Using a synthetic experiment, we showed that ABT twice a week (ABT 3) performed the best, detecting 5.7% of infected workers, compared to 16.9% when no ABT was applied. $R_e$ was reduced from 1.75 to 0.84, with a slight decrease in the active workers within the firm. A sensitivity analysis on the duration of the shedding period and sensitivity of ABT was performed and led to the same qualitative conclusions. We applied this protocol in a Chilean winery: the estimation of the initial $R_e$ of 1.3 was reduced to 0.7 when the ABT 3 protocol was implemented, with a 27% decrease in the number of infected workers. Although ABT is not approved for COVID-19 diagnosis, our study shows that upgraded safety standards can already be implemented in workspaces.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimate the time- varying R0 nationally and in twelve cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within hospital dynamics. We use individual-level data of >1,000 hospitalized patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalizations and deaths. We estimate the national R0 was 3.15 (95% CI: 2.13-3.76) at the start of the epidemic. Starting from around March 6, we find a strong reduction in R0 with an 85% median decrease (95% quantile range, QR: 83%-90%) to a value of 0.44 (95% QR: 0.27-0.65) in the period of March 29-April 5. At the cantonal-level R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 71% and 94%. We found that reductions in R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We found that most of the reduction of transmission is due to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 3% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of R0 well below one are promising. However most of inferred transmission reduction was due to behaviour change (<3% due to natural immunity buildup), with an estimated 97% (95% QR: 96.6%-97.2%) of the Swiss population still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 as of April 24. These results warrant a cautious relaxation of social distance practices and close monitoring of changes in both the basic and effective reproduction numbers.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Hence, failure to establish and implement scientifically reliable control measures may have a significant effect on the incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, severity of the disease, and death toll. The average number of secondary transmissions from an infected person, or reproduction numbers (R(0) and R), and the points at which the collective immunity begins to reduce the transmission of the infection, or herd immunity thresholds, are important epidemiological tools used in strategies of Covid-19 control, suppression, and mitigation. However, SARS-CoV-2 transmission through asymptomatic carriers and, possibly, aerosols, has been ignored, and this may affect the effectiveness of Covid-19 control strategies. Therefore, consideration of the two possible ways of transmission would substantially increase the values of reproduction numbers, but if estimates of the contingent of the population naturally resistant to the virus, plus those with pre-existing cross-immunity to SARS-CoV-2 were considered, the evaluation of herd immunity thresholds should reach their real and achievable levels.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We hypothesized autoantibodies against angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the SARS-CoV-2 receptor expressed on vascular endothelium, are generated during COVID-19 and are of mechanistic importance. METHODS: In an opportunity sample of 118 COVID-19 inpatients, autoantibodies recognizing ACE2 were detected by ELISA. Binding properties of anti-ACE2 IgM were analyzed via biolayer interferometry. Effects of anti-ACE2 IgM on complement activation and endothelial function were demonstrated in a tissue-engineered pulmonary microvessel model. RESULTS: Anti-ACE2 IgM (not IgG) autoantibodies were associated with severe COVID-19 and found in 18/66 (27.2%) patients with severe disease compared with 2/52 (3.8%) of patients with moderate disease (OR 9.38, 95% CI 2.38\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015342.0; P = 0.0009). Anti-ACE2 IgM autoantibodies were rare (2/50) in non-COVID-19 ventilated patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. Unexpectedly, ACE2-reactive IgM autoantibodies in COVID-19 did not undergo class-switching to IgG and had apparent K(D) values of 5.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015321.7 nM, indicating they are T cell independent. Anti-ACE2 IgMs activated complement and initiated complement-binding and functional changes in endothelial cells in microvessels, suggesting they contribute to the angiocentric pathology of COVID-19. CONCLUSION: We identify anti-ACE2 IgM as a mechanism-based biomarker strongly associated with severe clinical outcomes in SARS-CoV-2 infection, which has therapeutic implications.

The virus was named as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses on 11 February, 2020. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model for calculating the transmissibility of the virus. METHODS: In this study, we developed a Bats-Hosts-Reservoir-People transmission network model for simulating the potential transmission from the infection source (probably be bats) to the human infection. Since the Bats-Hosts-Reservoir network was hard to explore clearly and public concerns were focusing on the transmission from Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market (reservoir) to people, we simplified the model as Reservoir-People (RP) transmission network model. The next generation matrix approach was adopted to calculate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) from the RP model to assess the transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: The value of R(0) was estimated of 2.30 from reservoir to person and 3.58 from person to person which means that the expected number of secondary infections that result from introducing a single infected individual into an otherwise susceptible population was 3.58.

In the United States (US), different state governments have adopted various combinations of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions (NPIs), such as non-essential business closures and gathering bans, to mitigate the epidemic from February to April, 2020. Quantitative assessment on the effectiveness of NPIs is greatly needed to assist in guiding individualized decision making for adjustment of interventions in the US and around the world. However, the impacts of these approaches remain uncertain. METHODS: Based on the reported cases, the effective reproduction number (Rt) of COVID-19 epidemic for 50 states in the US was estimated. Measurements on the effectiveness of nine different NPIs were conducted by assessing risk ratios (RRs) between Rt and NPIs through a generalized linear model (GLM). RESULTS: Different NPIs were found to have led to different levels of reduction in Rt. Stay-at-home contributed approximately 51% (95% CI 46-57%), wearing (face) masks 29% (15-42%), gathering ban (more than 10 people) 19% (14-24%), non-essential business closure 16% (10-21%), declaration of emergency 13% (8-17%), interstate travel restriction 11% (5-16%), school closure 10% (7-14%), initial business closure 10% (6-14%), and gathering ban (more than 50 people) 7% (2-11%). CONCLUSIONS: This retrospective assessment of NPIs on Rt has shown that NPIs played critical roles on epidemic control in the US in the past several months.

While active surveillance throughout the semester such as widespread testing, contact tracing, and case isolation, may assist in detecting and preventing early outbreaks, these strategies will not be sufficient should a larger outbreak occur. It is therefore necessary to limit the initial number of active cases at the start of the semester. We examine the impact of pre-semester NAT testing on disease spread in a university setting. Methods: We implement simple dynamic transmission models of SARS-CoV-2 infection to explore the effects of pre-semester testing strategies on the number of active infections and occupied isolation beds throughout the semester. We assume an infectious period of 3 days and vary R0 to represent the effectiveness of disease mitigation strategies throughout the semester. We assume the prevalence of active cases at the beginning of the semester is 5%. The sensitivity of the NAT test is set at 90%. Results: If no pre-semester screening is mandated, the peak number of active infections occurs in under 10 days and the size of the peak is substantial, ranging from 5,000 active infections when effective mitigation strategies (R0 = 1.25) are implemented to over 15,000 active infections for less effective strategies (R0 = 3). When one NAT test is mandated within one week of campus arrival, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak to 40 days and 17 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. When two NAT tests are mandated, effective (R0 = 1.25) and less effective (R0 = 3) mitigation strategies delay the onset of the peak through the end of fall semester and 20 days, respectively, and result in peak size ranging from less than 1,000 to over 15,000 active infections. If maximum occupancy of isolation beds is set to 2% of the student population, then isolation beds would only be available for a range of 1 in 2 confirmed cases (R0 = 1.25) to 1 in 40 confirmed cases (R0 = 3) before maximum occupancy is reached. Conclusion: Even with highly effective mitigation strategies throughout the semester, inadequate pre-semester testing will lead to early and large surges of the disease and result in universities quickly reaching their isolation bed capacity. We therefore recommend NAT testing within one week of campus return. While this strategy is sufficient for delaying the timing of the outbreak, pre-semester testing would need to be implemented in conjunction with effective mitigation strategies to reduce the outbreak size.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods: SEIR dynamics model was used to fit daily onset infections to search the start date of this resurgent COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing. The number of cumulative infections from June 12 to July 1 in Beijing were fitted considering different levels of control strength. Results: The current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic in Beijing probably started between May 22 and May 28 (cumulative probability: 95%), with the highest probability on May 25 (23%). The R(0) of the current reemerged COVID-19 epidemic was 4.22 (95%CI: 2.88-7.02). Dynamic model fitting suggested that by June 11, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reached 99 (95%CI: 77-121), which was in line with the actual situation, and without control, by July 1, the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases would reach 65 090 (95%CI: 39 068-105 037). Since June 12,comprehensive prevention and control measures have been implemented in Beijing, as of July 1,compared with uncontrolled situation, the number of infections had been reduced by 99%, similar to the fitting result of a 95% reduction of the transmission rate. The sensitivity analysis showed consistent results. Conclusions: For the emergent outbreak of COVID-19, the dynamics model can be used to infer the start time of the transmission and help tracing the source of epidemic.

                "prompt": "Changes in social contacts in England during the COVID-19 pandemic between March 2020 and March 2021 as measured by the CoMix survey: A repeated cross-sectional study\nBACKGROUND: During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the United Kingdom government imposed public health policies in England to reduce social contacts in hopes of curbing virus transmission. We conducted a repeated cross-sectional study to measure contact patterns weekly from March 2020 to March 2021 to estimate the impact of these policies, covering 3 national lockdowns interspersed by periods of less restrictive policies. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The repeated cross-sectional survey data were collected using online surveys of representative samples of the UK population by age and gender. Survey participants were recruited by the online market research company Ipsos MORI through internet-based banner and social media ads and email campaigns. The participant data used for this analysis are restricted to those who reported living in England. We calculated the mean daily contacts reported using a (clustered) bootstrap and fitted a censored negative binomial model to estimate age-stratified contact matrices and estimate proportional changes to the basic reproduction number under controlled conditions using the change in contacts as a scaling factor. To put the findings in perspective, we discuss contact rates recorded throughout the year in terms of previously recorded rates from the POLYMOD study social contact study. The survey recorded 101,350 observations from 19,914 participants who reported 466,710 contacts over 53 weeks. We observed changes in social contact patterns in England over time and by participants\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 age, personal risk factors, and perception of risk. The mean reported contacts for adults 18 to 59 years old ranged between 2.39 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.20 to 2.60) contacts and 4.93 (95% CI 4.65 to 5.19) contacts during the study period. The mean contacts for school-age children (5 to 17 years old) ranged from 3.07 (95% CI 2.89 to 3.27) to 15.11 (95% CI 13.87 to 16.41). This demonstrates a sustained decrease in social contacts compared to a mean of 11.08 (95% CI 10.54 to 11.57) contacts per participant in all age groups combined as measured by the POLYMOD social contact study in 2005 to 2006. Contacts measured during periods of lockdowns were lower than in periods of eased social restrictions. The use of face coverings outside the home has remained high since the government mandated use in some settings in July 2020. The main limitations of this analysis are the potential for selection bias, as participants are recruited through internet-based campaigns, and recall bias, in which participants may under- or overreport the number of contacts they have made. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we observed that recorded contacts reduced dramatically compared to prepandemic levels (as measured in the POLYMOD study), with changes in reported contacts correlated with government interventions throughout the pandemic. Despite easing of restrictions in the summer of 2020, the mean number of reported contacts only returned to about half of that observed prepandemic at its highest recorded level. The CoMix survey provides a unique repeated cross-sectional data set for a full year in England, from the first day of the first lockdown, for use in statistical analyses and mathematical modelling of COVID-19 and other diseases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Could changes in the airborne pollutant particulate matter acting as a viral vector have exerted selective pressure to cause COVID-19 evolution?\nAir pollution with particulate matter has been implicated in the incidence and the mortality due to COVID-19 infection. The levels of particulate matter have been shown to have decreased after regional and national lockdowns in a number of countries. COVID-19 possesses an elevated reproduction number (R0) due to its high transmission rate. COVID-19 genes have been found adherent to particulate matter which has been suggested as a vector for this virus' transmission. Following lockdown in China, the original viral Clade D steadily decreased mirroring the decline in particulate matter. Two months after the COVID-19 index case was reported in Wuhan early December 2019, a persistent mutation was noted at the D614 gene position of the viral spike protein establishing the Clade G variant. Clade G started to appear early in February and steadily attained predominance after lockdown in late February. It may be postulated that the changes in the source of airborne particulate matter, possibly derived from tobacco smoking (66% of Chinese males are smokers), may have contributed to the appearance of Clade G. Once the pandemic spread beyond China, in all countries affected except for Iceland, a consistent pattern arose whereby the initial viral Clade D outbreak was rapidly displaced by Clade G. It is hypothesized that changes in the source of COVID-19's vector in the form of particulate matter may have contributed to natural selection favouring Clade G. The \"open orientation\" of Clade G spike protein's three peptides as opposed to the \"closed orientation\" of the Clade D may have allowed easier adherence of the viral mutant to cells and as a corollary also to particulate matter. There may also have been differences between both viral Clades in the spike protein's hydrophobic properties. Experimental research on the hypothesis that particulate matter may potentially act as a COVID-19 vector needs to be undertaken. Besides the potential vector effect, the deleterious effects of particulate matter on respiratory immunity and cardiovascular health are well known and consequently airborne pollution in all its forms should be addressed on a global scale.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: Participants were 155 individuals who completed the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NOCHES) Study and a COVID sub-study (95% Hispanic/Latino). Participants were asked whether, as a result of the pandemic, they have experienced more schedule regularity, improved/worsened sleep, more initial or middle-of-the-night insomnia, more sleepiness, and more napping. They were also asked whether they experienced more, fewer, or the same amount of dreams in general, positive dreams, and negative dreams. Multinomial logistic regressions were used to examine overall, positive, and negative dream recall (more or less vs same) as outcome and perceived change in sleep as independent variable, adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomics, and mental health symptoms (assessed with PHQ4). RESULTS: Those who reported more schedule regularity were less likely to report more negative dreams (Relative Risk Ratio [RRR]=0.40, p=0.010). Those who reported improved sleep were also more likely to report more positive dreams (RRR=3.97, p=0.004). Those with worsened sleep were more likely to report fewer dreams overall (RRR=2.23, p=0.037), fewer positive dreams (RRR=2.24, p=0.003) and more negative dreams (RRR=3.69, p<0.0005). Those with more initial insomnia were more likely to report fewer positive dreams (RRR=2.43, p=0.002) and more negative dreams (RRR=4.12, p<0.0005). Those with more middle-of-the-night insomnia reported fewer dreams overall (RRR=2.35, p=0.018), fewer positive dreams (RRR=2.55, p=0.001), and more negative dreams (RRR=5.01, p<0.0005). Those with more daytime sleepiness were more likely to report fewer dreams overall (RRR=4.75, p<0.0005), fewer positive dreams (RRR=1.92, p=0.019), and more negative dreams (RRR=3.91, p<0.0005), and were less likely to report more positive dreams (RRR=0.26, p=0.018). Those who reported napping more were more likely to report fewer dreams overall (RRR=2.78, p=0.008), fewer positive dreams (RRR=2.10, P=0.008), and more negative dreams (RRR=2.83, p=0.003), and were less likely to report more positive dreams (RRR=0.16, p=0.004).

Omicron is found to be significantly more transmissible compared to its predecessors and therefore almost every impacted country is exhibiting new infection peaks than seen earlier. In this work, we analyze the global statistics of Omicron-impacted countries including South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and Italy to quantitatively estimate the intensity and severity of recent waves. Next, these statistics are used to estimate the impact of Omicron in India, which is experiencing an intense third wave of COVID-19 since 28 Dec., 2021. The rapid surge in the daily number of infections, comparable to the global trends, strongly suggests the dominance of the Omicron variant in infections in India. The logarithmic regression suggests the early growth rate of infections in this wave is nearly four times that in the second wave. Another notable difference in this wave is the relatively concurrent arrival of outbreaks all across the country; the effective reproduction number (Rt) although has significant variations among different regions. The test positivity rate (TPR) also displays a rapid growth in the last 10 days in several states. Preliminary estimates with the Susceptible-Infected-Removed (SIR) model suggest that the peak in India to occur in late January 2022 with a caseload exceeding that in the second wave. Although global Omicron trends, as analyzed in this work, suggest a decline in case fatality rate and hospitalizations compared to Delta, a sudden accumulation of active infections can potentially choke the already stressed healthcare infrastructure for the next few weeks.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We evaluated the impact of a 2-dose COVID-19 vaccination campaign on reducing incidence, hospitalizations, and deaths in the United States (US). METHODS: We developed an agent-based model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and parameterized it with US demographics and age-specific COVID-19 outcomes. Healthcare workers and high-risk individuals were prioritized for vaccination, while children under 18 years of age were not vaccinated. We considered a vaccine efficacy of 95% against disease following 2 doses administered 21 days apart achieving 40% vaccine coverage of the overall population within 284 days. We varied vaccine efficacy against infection, and specified 10% pre-existing population immunity for the base-case scenario. The model was calibrated to an effective reproduction number of 1.2, accounting for current non-pharmaceutical interventions in the US. RESULTS: Vaccination reduced the overall attack rate to 4.6% (95% CrI: 4.3% - 5.0%) from 9.0% (95% CrI: 8.4% - 9.4%) without vaccination, over 300 days. The highest relative reduction (54-62%) was observed among individuals aged 65 and older. Vaccination markedly reduced adverse outcomes, with non-ICU hospitalizations, ICU hospitalizations, and deaths decreasing by 63.5% (95% CrI: 60.3% - 66.7%), 65.6% (95% CrI: 62.2% - 68.6%), and 69.3% (95% CrI: 65.5% - 73.1%), respectively, across the same period. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that vaccination can have a substantial impact on mitigating COVID-19 outbreaks, even with limited protection against infection.

The present study aimed to conduct a contact survey in Japan, offering estimates of contact by age and location and validating a social contact matrix using a seroepidemiological dataset of influenza. METHODS: An internet-based questionnaire survey was conducted, covering all 47 prefectures in Japan and including a total of 1476 households. The social contact matrix was quantified assuming reciprocity and using the maximum likelihood method. By imposing several parametric assumptions for the next-generation matrix, the empirical seroepidemiological data of influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was analysed and we estimated the basic reproduction number, R(0). RESULTS: In total, the reported number of contacts on weekdays was 10,682 whereas that on weekend days was 8867. Strong age-dependent assortativity was identified. Forty percent of weekday contacts took place at schools or workplaces, but that declined to 14% on weekends. Accounting for the age-dependent heterogeneity with the known social contact matrix, the minimum value of the Akaike information criterion was obtained and R(0) was estimated at 1.45 (95% confidence interval: 1.42, 1.49). CONCLUSIONS: Survey datasets will be useful for parameterizing the heterogeneous transmission model of various directly transmitted infectious diseases in Japan. Age-dependent assortativity, especially among children, along with numerous contacts in school settings on weekdays implies the potential effectiveness of school closure.

To enable effective responses to these pathogens in the event that they undergo future emergence, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations is advancing the development of vaccines for several pathogens prioritized by the World Health Organization. A major challenge in this pursuit is anticipating demand for a vaccine stockpile to support outbreak response. We developed a modeling framework for outbreak response for emerging zoonoses under three reactive vaccination strategies. Annual vaccine regimen requirements for a population-wide strategy ranged from >670,000 (95% prediction interval: 0-3,630,000) for Lassa virus to 1,190,000 (95% PrI: 0-8,480,000) for Rift Valley fever virus, while the regimens required for ring vaccination or targeting healthcare workers (HCWs) were several orders of magnitude lower. For each pathogen and vaccination strategy, reactive vaccination typically prevented fewer than 10% of cases, because of their presently low R0 values. Targeting HCWs had a higher per-regimen impact than population-wide vaccination. Our framework provides a flexible methodology for estimating vaccine stockpile needs and the geographic distribution of demand under a range of outbreak response scenarios.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Within the proposed model, the entire population is divided into nine groups, each with its own set of parameters and initial values. A nonlinear system of fractional differential equations for the model is represented using Caputo fractional derivative. Legendre spectral collocation method is used to convert this system into an algebraic system of equations. An inexact Newton iterative method is used to solve the model system.

                "prompt": "Changing transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in China: a nationwide population-based piecewise mathematical modelling study\nBackground: The first case of COVID-19 atypical pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, China on December 1, 2019. Since then, at least 33 other countries have been affected and there is a possibility of a global outbreak. A tremendous amount of effort has been made to understand its transmission dynamics; however, the temporal and spatial transmission heterogeneity and changing epidemiology have been mostly ignored. The epidemic mechanism of COVID-19 remains largely unclear. Methods: Epidemiological data on COVID-19 in China and daily population movement data from Wuhan to other cities were obtained and analyzed. To describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 at different spatio-temporal scales, we used a three-stage continuous-time Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) meta-population model based on the characteristics and transmission dynamics of each stage: 1) local epidemic from December 1, 2019 to January 9, 2020; 2) long-distance spread due to the Spring Festival travel rush from January 10 to 22, 2020; and 3) intra-provincial transmission from January 23, 2020 when travel restrictions were imposed. Together with the basic reproduction number (R_0) for mathematical modelling, we also considered the variation in infectivity and introduced the controlled reproduction number (R_c) by assuming that exposed individuals to be infectious; we then simulated the future spread of COVID across Wuhan and all the provinces in mainland China. In addition, we built a novel source tracing algorithm to infer the initial exposed number of individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020, to estimate the number of infections early during this epidemic. Findings: The spatial patterns of disease spread were heterogeneous. The estimated controlled reproduction number (R_c) in the neighboring provinces of Hubei province were relatively large, and the nationwide reproduction number (except for Hubei) ranged from 0.98 to 2.74 with an average of 1.79 (95% CI 1.77-1.80). Infectivity was significantly greater for exposed than infectious individuals, and exposed individuals were predicted to have become the major source of infection after January 23. For the epidemic process, most provinces reached their epidemic peak before February 10, 2020. It is expected that the maximum number of infections will be approached by the end of March. The final infectious size is estimated to be about 58,000 for Wuhan, 20,800 for the rest of Hubei province, and 17,000 for the other provinces in mainland China. Moreover, the estimated number of the exposed individuals is much greater than the officially reported number of infectious individuals in Wuhan on January 10, 2020. Interpretation: The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 have been changing over time and were heterogeneous across regions. There was a substantial underestimation of the number of exposed individuals in Wuhan early in the epidemic, and the Spring Festival travel rush played an important role in enhancing and accelerating the spread of COVID-19.

Current approaches do not quantify the uncertainty correctly in estimating $R_t$, as expected by the observed variability in contagion patterns. We elaborate on the Bayesian estimation of $R_t$ by improving on the Poisson sampling model of Cori et al. (2013). By adding an autoregressive latent process, we build a Dynamic Linear Model on the log of observed $R_t$s, resulting in a filtering type Bayesian inference. We use a conjugate analysis, and all calculations are explicit. Results show an improved uncertainty quantification on the estimation of $R_t$'s, with a reliable method that could safely be used by non-experts and within other forecasting systems.

A large number of inbound travelers from other regions could lead to a renewed outbreak of COVID-19 in the local regions. Globally, as a result of the imbalance in the control of the epidemic, all countries are facing the risk of a renewed COVID-19 outbreak brought about by travelers from epidemic areas. Therefore, studies on a proper management of the inbound travelers are urgent. Methods: We collected a total of 4,733,414 inbound travelers and 174 COVID-19 diagnosed patients in Yunnan province from 21 January 2020 to 20 February 2020. Data on place of origin, travel history, age, and gender, as well as whether they had suspected clinical manifestations for inbound travelers in Yunnan were collected. The impact of inbound travelers on the local epidemic was analyzed with a collinear statistical analysis and the effect of the control measures on the epidemic was evaluated with a sophisticated modeling approach. Results: Of the 174 COVID-19 patients, 60.9% were not from Yunnan, and 76.4% had a history of travel in Hubei. The amount of new daily cases in Yunnan was significant correlated with the number of inbound travelers from Hubei and suspected cases among them.

Other vulnerable regions, such as South Africa and several parts of South America have also seen cases rise, further impacting local economies and livelihoods. Despite substantial research efforts to date, it remains unresolved as to whether COVID-19 transmission has the same sensitivity to climate observed for other common respiratory viruses such as seasonal influenza. Here, we look for empirical evidence of seasonality using a robust estimation framework. For 359 large cities across the world, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) using logistic growth curves fitted to cumulative case data. We then assess evidence for association with climatic variables through ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.

Meanwhile, we are also experiencing an infodemic induced by the overabundance of information, some accurate and some inaccurate, spreading rapidly across social media platforms. Social media has arguably shifted the information acquisition and dissemination of a considerably large population of internet users toward higher interactivities. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate COVID-19-related health beliefs on one of the mainstream social media platforms, Twitter, as well as potential impacting factors associated with fluctuations in health beliefs on social media. METHODS: We used COVID-19-related posts from the mainstream social media platform Twitter to monitor health beliefs. A total of 92,687,660 tweets corresponding to 8,967,986 unique users from January 6 to June 21, 2020, were retrieved. To quantify health beliefs, we employed the health belief model (HBM) with four core constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and perceived barriers. We utilized natural language processing and machine learning techniques to automate the process of judging the conformity of each tweet with each of the four HBM constructs. A total of 5000 tweets were manually annotated for training the machine learning architectures. RESULTS: The machine learning classifiers yielded areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves over 0.86 for the classification of all four HBM constructs. Our analyses revealed a basic reproduction number R0 of 7.62 for trends in the number of Twitter users posting health belief-related content over the study period. The fluctuations in the number of health belief-related tweets could reflect dynamics in case and death statistics, systematic interventions, and public events. Specifically, we observed that scientific events, such as scientific publications, and nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, were comparable in their ability to influence health belief trends on social media through a Kruskal-Wallis test (P=.78 and P=.92 for perceived benefits and perceived barriers, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: As an analogy of the classic epidemiology model where an infection is considered to be spreading in a population with an R0 greater than 1, we found that the number of users tweeting about COVID-19 health beliefs was amplifying in an epidemic manner and could partially intensify the infodemic. It is \"unhealthy\" that both scientific and nonscientific events constitute no disparity in impacting the health belief trends on Twitter, since nonscientific events, such as politicians' speeches, might not be endorsed by substantial evidence and could sometimes be misleading.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Exposure to racially targeted police violence and the disproportionate impact of COVID on their communities have been particularly salient stressors for African Americans. Aims for this presentation are to illuminate the emotional impact of COVID and racism on young adult African Americans and their relationship to sleep problems. METHODS: An online survey was sent to participants in an ongoing study focusing on sleep and health along with new participants recruited through a snowball method. The survey included the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Impact of Event scale (IES), as well as items to assess experiences with COVID, exposure to racially targeted violence, and disparate community impact. RESULTS: Respondents were African Americans age 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015335. 45% endorsed worsening sleep during the pandemic. 25% had ISI scores of probable insomnia and 61% had IES scores above the symptom threshold for clinical concern. Racism-related distress was endorsed at higher levels than worries related to COVID. There was a significant relationship of insomnia severity with the number of COVID related stressors and a trend level relationship with COVID worries. Sleep outcomes were not correlated with racism-related distress. CONCLUSION: While distress related to racism was endorsed more than COVID worries, our preliminary findings suggest COVID worries but not racism exposure negatively impact sleep health. This may be a consequence of habituation to the chronic stress of racism in contrast with the novel stress of COVID.

High correlation was observed between the socio-economic parameters and epidemiology parameters at regional level in Cameroon. Also, the method was applied to the second wave COVID-19 outbreak for the world data which is a period the phenomena we are considering was observed.

In this regard, the province-wise data from Nepal provides a unique opportunity to study the effective control strategies. This is because (a) some provinces of Nepal share an open-border with India, resulting in a significantly high inflow of COVID-19 cases from India; (b) despite the inflow of a considerable number of cases, the local spread was quite controlled until mid-June of 2020, presumably due to control policies implemented; and (c) the relaxation of policies caused a rapid surge of the COVID-19 cases, providing a multi-phasic trend of disease dynamics. In this study, we used this unique data set to explore the inter-provincial disparities of the important indicators, such as epidemic trend, epidemic growth rate, and reproduction numbers. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to identify prevention and control policies that are effective in altering these indicators. Our analysis identified a noticeable inter-province variation in the epidemic trend (3 per day to 104 per day linear increase during third surge period), the median daily growth rate (1 to 4% per day exponential growth), the basic reproduction number (0.71 to 1.21), and the effective reproduction number (maximum values ranging from 1.20 to 2.86).

Serial interval (SI), time between the onset of symptoms of a primary case and a secondary case, is a key epidemiological parameter. We estimated SI of COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China based on 27 records of transmission chains. We adopted three parametric models: Weibull, lognormal and gamma distributions, and an interval-censored likelihood framework. The three models were compared using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AICc). We also fitted the epidemic curve of COVID-19 to the logistic growth model to estimate the reproduction number. Using a Weibull distribution, we estimated the mean SI to be 5.9 days (95% CI: 3.9-9.6) with a standard deviation (SD) of 4.8 days (95% CI: 3.1-10.1). Using a logistic growth model, we estimated the basic reproduction number in Shenzhen to be 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4-2.8). The SI of COVID-19 is relatively shorter than that of SARS and MERS, the other two betacoronavirus diseases, which suggests the iteration of the transmission may be rapid.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The open data on the number of COVID-19 cases reported at daily basis form the globe were used to assess the evolution of outbreaks with international air link on the same latitude and also including Taiwan. The dynamic Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model was used to evaluate continental transmission from December 2019 to March 2020 before the declaration of COVID-19 pandemic with basic reproductive number and effective reproductive number before and after containment measurements. RESULTS: For the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, the estimated reproductive number was reduced from 2.84 during the overwhelming outbreaks in early January to 0.43 after the strict lockdown policy. It is very surprising to find there were three countries (including South Korea, Iran, and Italy) and the Washington state of the USA on the 38\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0 North Latitude involved with large-scale community-acquired outbreaks since the first imported COVID-19 cases from China. The propagation of continental transmission was augmented from hotspot to hotspot with higher reproductive number immediately before the declaration of pandemic. By contrast, there was not any large community-acquired outbreak in Taiwan. CONCLUSION: The propagated spatiotemporal transmission from China to other hotspots may explain the emerging pandemic that can only be exempted by timely border control and preparedness of containment measurements according to Taiwan experience.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Spatio-temporal disease mapping models, which allow dealing with highly disaggregated spatial and temporal units of analysis, are a priority in this sense. Spatio-temporal models provide a geographically detailed and temporally updated overview of the current state of the pandemics, making public health interventions to be more effective. Moreover, the use of spatio-temporal disease mapping models in the new Covid-19 epidemic context, facilitates estimating newly demanded epidemiological indicators, such as the instantaneous reproduction number (R_t), even for small areas. This, in turn, allows to adapt traditional disease mapping models to these new circumstancies and make their results more useful in this particular context. In this paper we propose a new spatio-temporal disease mapping model, particularly suited to Covid-19 surveillance. As an additional result, we derive instantaneous reproduction number estimates for small areas, enabling monitoring this parameter with a high spatial disaggregation. We illustrate the use of our proposal with the separate study of the disease pandemics in two Spanish regions. As a result, we illustrate how touristic flows could haved shaped the spatial distribution of the disease. In these real studies, we also propose new surveillance tools that can be used by regional public health services to make a more efficient use of their resources.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Feasibility of Controlling COVID-19 Outbreaks in the UK by Rolling Interventions\nBackground: Recent outbreak of a novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in China has led a rapid global spread around the world. For controlling COVID-19 outbreaks, many countries have implemented two non-pharmaceutical interventions: suppression like immediate lockdowns in cities at epicentre of outbreak; or mitigation that slows down but not stopping epidemic for reducing peak healthcare demand. Both interventions have apparent pros and cons; the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is limited. We aimed to conduct a feasibility study for robustly estimating the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, peaks and lengths of COVID-19 breakouts by taking multiple pharmaceutical interventions in London and the UK, accounting for reduction of healthcare demand. Methods: We developed a model to attempt to infer the impact of mitigation, suppression and multiple rolling interventions for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and the UK. Our model assumed that each intervention has equivalent effect on the reproduction number R across countries and over time; where its intensity was presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals; early immediate intensive intervention led to increased health need and social anxiety. We considered two important features: direct link between Exposed and Recovered population, and practical healthcare demand by separation of infections into mild and critical cases. Our model was fitted and calibrated with data on cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan and Hubei to estimate how suppression intervention impacted on the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths over time during January 2020, and April 2020. We combined the calibrated model with data on the cases of COVID-19 in London, the UK (non-London) and the UK during February 2020 and March 2020 to estimate the number and distribution of infections, growth of deaths, and healthcare demand by using multiple interventions. Findings: We estimated given that multiple interventions with an intensity range from 3 to 15, one optimal strategy was to take suppression with intensity 3 in London from 23rd March for 100 days, and 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in non-London regions. In this scenario, the total infections and deaths in the UK were limited to 2.43 million and 33.8 thousand; the peak time of healthcare demand was due to the 65th day (April 11th), where it needs hospital beds for 25.3 thousand severe and critical cases. If we took a simultaneous 3 weeks rolling intervention with intensity between 3 and 5 in all regions of the UK, the total infections and deaths increased slightly to 2.69 million and 37 thousand; the peak time of healthcare kept the same at the 65th day, where it needs equivalent hospital beds for severe and critical cases of 25.3 thousand. But if we released high band of rolling intervention intensity to 6 or 8 and simultaneously implemented them in all regions of the UK, the COVID-19 outbreak would not end in 1 year and distribute a multi-modal mode, where the total infections and deaths in the UK possibly reached to 16.2 million and 257 thousand.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

It is well known that the transmissibility can be measured by reproduction number. For this reason, the large amount of research focuses on the estimations of reproduction number of COVID-19.

An understanding of the factors that affect severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection will help fight the COVID-19 pandemic. This study sought to investigate the association between SARS-CoV-2 infection and blood type distribution. The big data provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Johns Hopkins University were used to assess the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic. The infection data in the early phase of the pandemic from six countries in each of six geographic zones divided according to the WHO were used, representing approximately 5.4 billion people around the globe. We calculated the infection growth factor, doubling times of infection and death cases, reproductive number and infection and death cases in relation to the blood type distribution. The growth factor of infection and death cases significantly and positively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type A and negatively correlated with the proportion of the population with blood type B. Compared with the lower blood type A population (<30%), the higher blood type A population (\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u00a9\u00c2\u00be30%) showed more infection and death cases, higher growth factors and shorter case doubling times for infections and deaths and thus higher epidemic dynamics.

However, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of specific NPIs has been inconsistent. We assessed the effectiveness of NPIs around internal containment and closure, international travel restrictions, economic measures, and health system actions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in 130 countries and territories. METHODS: We used panel (longitudinal) regression to estimate the effectiveness of 13 categories of NPIs in reducing SARS-CoV-2 transmission using data from January to June 2020. First, we examined the temporal association between NPIs using hierarchical cluster analyses. We then regressed the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 against different NPIs. We examined different model specifications to account for the temporal lag between NPIs and changes in R(t), levels of NPI intensity, time-varying changes in NPI effect, and variable selection criteria. Results were interpreted taking into account both the range of model specifications and temporal clustering of NPIs. RESULTS: There was strong evidence for an association between two NPIs (school closure, internal movement restrictions) and reduced R(t). Another three NPIs (workplace closure, income support, and debt/contract relief) had strong evidence of effectiveness when ignoring their level of intensity, while two NPIs (public events cancellation, restriction on gatherings) had strong evidence of their effectiveness only when evaluating their implementation at maximum capacity (e.g. restrictions on 1000+ people gathering were not effective, restrictions on < 10 people gathering were). Evidence about the effectiveness of the remaining NPIs (stay-at-home requirements, public information campaigns, public transport closure, international travel controls, testing, contact tracing) was inconsistent and inconclusive. We found temporal clustering between many of the NPIs. Effect sizes varied depending on whether or not we included data after peak NPI intensity. CONCLUSION: Understanding the impact that specific NPIs have had on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is complicated by temporal clustering, time-dependent variation in effects, and differences in NPI intensity. However, the effectiveness of school closure and internal movement restrictions appears robust across different model specifications, with some evidence that other NPIs may also be effective under particular conditions. This provides empirical evidence for the potential effectiveness of many, although not all, actions policy-makers are taking to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Understanding the evolving epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the outbreak beyond Hubei would provide timely information to guide intervention policy. METHODS: We collected individual information from official public sources on laboratory-confirmed cases reported outside Hubei in mainland China for the period of Jan 19 to Feb 17, 2020. We used the date of the fourth revision of the case definition (Jan 27) to divide the epidemic into two time periods (Dec 24 to Jan 27, and Jan 28 to Feb 17) as the date of symptom onset. We estimated trends in the demographic characteristics of cases and key time-to-event intervals. We used a Bayesian approach to estimate the dynamics of the net reproduction number (Rt) at the provincial level. FINDINGS: We collected data on 8579 cases from 30 provinces. The median age of cases was 44 years (33-56), with an increasing proportion of cases in younger age groups and in elderly people (ie, aged >64 years) as the epidemic progressed. The mean time from symptom onset to hospital admission decreased from 4\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b74 days (95% CI 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70-14\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70) for the period of Dec 24 to Jan 27, to 2\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b76 days (0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70-9\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70) for the period of Jan 28 to Feb 17. The mean incubation period for the entire period was estimated at 5\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b72 days (1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b78-12\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b74) and the mean serial interval at 5\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days (1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b73-11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b76). The epidemic dynamics in provinces outside Hubei were highly variable but consistently included a mixture of case importations and local transmission. We estimated that the epidemic was self-sustained for less than 3 weeks, with mean Rt reaching peaks between 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b708 (95% CI 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b774-1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b754) in Shenzhen city of Guangdong province and 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b771 (1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b732-2\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b717) in Shandong province. In all the locations for which we had sufficient data coverage of Rt, Rt was estimated to be below the epidemic threshold (ie, <1) after Jan 30. INTERPRETATION: Our estimates of the incubation period and serial interval were similar, suggesting an early peak of infectiousness, with possible transmission before the onset of symptoms. Our results also indicate that, as the epidemic progressed, infectious individuals were isolated more quickly, thus shortening the window of transmission in the community. Overall, our findings indicate that strict containment measures, movement restrictions, and increased awareness of the population might have contributed to interrupt local transmission of SARS-CoV-2 outside Hubei province.

Like other countries, it also effected the economy and people of Pakistan. According to the publicly reported data, the first case of novel corona virus in Pakistan was reported on 27th February 2020. The aim of the present study is to describe the mathematical model and dynamics of COVID-19 in Pakistan. To investigate the spread of coronavirus in Pakistan, we develop the SEIR time fractional model with newly, developed fractional operator of Atangana-Baleanu. We present briefly the analysis of the given model and discuss its applications using world health organization (WHO) reported data for Pakistan. We consider the available infection cases from 19th March 2020, till 31st March 2020 and accordingly, various parameters are fitted or estimated. It is worth noting that we have calculated the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] which shows that virus is spreading rapidly. Furthermore, stability analysis of the model at disease free equilibrium DFE and endemic equilibriums EE is performed to observe the dynamics and transmission of the model. Finally, the AB fractional model is solved numerically. To show the effect of the various embedded parameters like fractional parameter [Formula: see text] on the model, various graphs are plotted. It is worth noting that the base of our investigation, we have predicted the spread of disease for next 200 days.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This study measures the impact of social distancing policies on COVID-19 transmission in US states during the early outbreak phase to assess which policies were most effective. METHODS: To measure transmissibility, we analyze the average effective reproductive number (R(t)) in each state the week following its 500th case and doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases. Linear and logistic regressions were performed to assess the impact of various NPIs while controlling for population density, GDP, and certain health metrics. This analysis was repeated for deaths with doubling time to 100 deaths with several healthcare infrastructure control variables. RESULTS: States with stay-at-home orders in place at the time of their 500th case were associated with lower average R(t) the following week compared to states without them (p<0.001) and significantly less likely to have an R(t)>1 (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.01-0.37, p=0.004). These states also experienced longer doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.17-0.72, p=0.004). States in the highest quartile of average time spent at home were also slower to reach 1000 cases than those in the lowest quartile (HR 0.18, 95% CI 0.06-0.53, p=0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Stay-at-home orders had the largest effect of any policy analyzed. Multivariate analyses with cellphone tracking data suggest social distancing adherence drives these effects. States that plan to scale back such measures should carefully monitor transmission metrics.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Finding appropriate measures that effectively contain the spread of the epidemic without putting a too severe pressure on social and economic life is major challenge for modern predictive approaches. To assess the impact of confinement (March 17th till May 11th) and deconfinement, we develop a novel rate model to monitor and predict the spread of the epidemic and its impact on the health care system. The model accounts for age-dependent interactions between population groups and predicts consequences for various infection categories such as number of infected, hospitalized, load of intensive care units (ICU), number of death, recovered and more. We use online health care data for the five most infected regions of France to calibrate the model. At day of deconfinement (May 11th), we find that 13% (around 4.8M) of the population is infected in the five most affected regions of France (extrapolating to 5.8M for France). The model predicts that if the reproduction rate R0 is reduced by at least a factor of 2.5-3 for all age groups, which could be achieved by wearing masks and social distancing, a significant second peak could be prevented. However, if the reduction in R0 for the age group 0-25 would be less and below 2 (school openings), a second peak is unavoidable in which case the ICU will be saturated. In that context testing should be focused on children, but it will nevertheless have a limited impact on reducing the spread.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility compared between variants of concern and vaccination status\nSince the start of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in late 2019, several variants of concern (VOC) have been reported to have increased transmissibility. In addition, despite the progress of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide, all vaccines currently in used are known to protect only partially from infection and onward transmission. We combined phylogenetic analysis with Bayesian inference under an epidemiological model to infer the reproduction number (Rt) and also trace person-to-person transmission. We examined the impact of phylogenetic uncertainty and sampling bias on the estimation. Our result indicated that lineage B had a significantly higher transmissibility than lineage A and contributed to the global pandemic to a large extent. In addition, although the transmissibility of VOCs is higher than other exponentially growing lineages, this difference is not very high. The probability of detecting onward transmission from patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 VOCs who had received at least one dose of vaccine was approximate 1.06% (3/284), which was slightly lower but not statistically significantly different from a probability of 1.21% (10/828) for unvaccinated individuals. In addition to VOCs, exponentially growing lineages in each country should also be account for when tailoring prevention and control strategies. One dose of vaccination could not efficiently prevent the onward transmission of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs. Consequently, nonpharmaceutical interventions (such as wearing masks and social distancing) should still be implemented in each country during the vaccination period.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Using an econometric approach, we found that trade openness increased cases and deaths, while the number of international cities connected at main airports increased r, cases and deaths. Similarly, increases in concentration of imports, a sign of uneven development, coincided with increases in early epidemic growth and deaths. These results suggest that countries whose used territory was defined by a less uneven development were less likely to show exacerbated COVID-19 patterns of transmission. Health outcomes were worst in more trade-dependent countries, even after controlling for the impact of transmission prevention and mitigation policies, highlighting how structural effects of economic integration in used territories were associated with the initial COVID-19 spread in Mesoamerica and the Caribbean.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Here, we evaluated 6710 clinical and preclinical compounds targeting 2183 host proteins by immunocytofluorescence-based screening to identify SARS-CoV-2 infection inhibitors. Computationally integrating relationships between small molecule structure, dose-response antiviral activity, host target and cell interactome networking produced cellular networks important for infection. This analysis revealed 389 small molecules, >12 scaffold classes and 813 host targets with micromolar to low nanomolar activities. From these classes, representatives were extensively evaluated for mechanism of action in stable and primary human cell models, and additionally against Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants and MERS-CoV. One promising candidate, obatoclax, significantly reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral lung load in mice. Ultimately, this work establishes a rigorous approach for future pharmacological and computational identification of novel host factor dependencies and treatments for viral diseases.

To date, the effectiveness of this mandate has not been well established. The quasi-experimental comparison between 5 year-old children, as a control group, and 6 year-old children, as an interventional group, provides us with the appropriate research conditions for addressing this issue. Methods: We performed a retrospective population-based study among 599,314 children aged 3 to 11 years attending preschool (3-5 years, without FCM mandate) and primary education (6-11 years, with FCM mandate) with the aim of calculating the incidence of SARS-CoV-2, secondary attack rates (SAR) and the effective reproductive number (R*) for each grade during the first trimester of the 2021-2022 academic year, and analysing the differences between 5-year-old, without FCM, and 6 year-old children, with FCM. Findings: SARS-CoV-2 incidence was significantly lower in preschool than in primary education, and an age-dependent trend was observed. Children aged 3 and 4 showed lower outcomes for all the analysed epidemiological variables, while children aged 11 had the higher values. Six-year-old children showed higher incidence than 5 year-olds (3\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b754% vs 3\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71%;OR: 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b715 [95%CI: 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b708-1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b722]) and slightly lower but not statistically significant SAR and R*: SAR were 4\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b736% in 6 year-old children, and 4\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b759% in 5 year-old (IRR: 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b796 [95%CI: 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b782-1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b711]);and R* was 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b79 and 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b793 (OR: 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b796 [95%CI: 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b787-1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b709]), respectively. Interpretation: FCM mandates in schools were not associated with lower SARS-CoV-2 incidence or transmission, suggesting that this intervention was not effective. Instead, age-dependency was the most important factor in explaining the transmission risk for children attending school.

To examine the change of the growth rate of the outbreak, we present estimates of the transmissibility of COVID-19 in the four most affected regions in the country: Seoul, Gyeonggi Province, Gyeongbuk Province, and Daegu. The daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in these regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We estimated the time-varying reproduction numbers in these regions by using the renewable equation determined by the serial interval of COVID-19. In Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, the first major peak of COVID-19 occurred in early March, with the estimated reproduction number in February being as high as 4.24 and 8.86, respectively. In Gyeongbuk Province, the reproduction number reached 3.49 in February 8 and declined to a value below 1.00 on March 10, 2020, and similarly in Daegu, it decreased from 4.38 to 1.00 between February 5 and March 5. However, the loosening of the restrictions imposed by the government has triggered a resurgence of new cases in all regions considered, resulting in a reproduction number in May 2020 estimated at 3.04 and 4.78 in Seoul and Gyeonggi Province, repectively.

                "prompt": "Critical levels of mask efficiency and of mask adoption that theoretically extinguish respiratory virus epidemics\nUsing a respiratory virus epidemiological model we derive equations for the critical levels of mask efficiency (fraction blocked) and mask adoption (fraction of population wearing masks) that lower the effective reproduction number to unity. The model extends a basic epidemiological model and assumes that a specified fraction of a population dons masks at a given initial number of infections. The model includes a contribution from the ocular (nasolacrimal duct) route, and does not include contributions from contact (fomite) routes. The model accommodates dose-response (probability of infection) functions that are linear or non-linear. Our motivation to study near-population-wide mask wearing arises from the concept that, between two mask wearers, the concentration of particles at inhalation should be the square of the mask penetration fraction. This combination, or team, of masks can provide a strong dose-lowering squaring effect, which enables the use of lower-efficiency, lower-cost, lower pressure-drop (easier breathing) masks. For an epidemic with basic reproduction number R0=2.5 and with a linear dose-response, the critical mask efficiency is calculated to be 0.5 for a mask adoption level of 0.8 of the population. Importantly, this efficiency is well below that of a N95 mask, and well above that of some fabric masks. Numerical solutions of the model at near-critical levels of mask efficiency and mask adoption demonstrate avoidance of epidemics. To be conservative we use mask efficiencies measured with the most-penetrating viral-particle sizes. The critical mask adoption level for surgical masks with an efficiency of 0.58 is computed to be 0.73. With surgical masks (or equally efficient substitutes) and 80% and 90% adoption levels, respiratory epidemics with R0 of about 3 and 4, respectively, would be theoretically extinguished.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the country. The outbreak rapidly escalated to a national level epidemic, amid the WHO declaration of a pandemic. Methods We analysed data from the national case-based integrated surveillance system of all RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 infections as of March 24th 2020, collected from all Italian regions and autonomous provinces. Here we provide a descriptive epidemiological summary on the first 62,843 COVID-19 cases in Italy as well as estimates of the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. Findings Of the 62,843 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 71.6% were reported from three Regions (Lombardia, Veneto and Emilia-Romagna). All cases reported after February 20th were locally acquired. Estimates of R0 varied between 2.5 (95%CI: 2.18-2.83) in Toscana and 3 (95%CI: 2.68-3.33) in Lazio, with epidemic doubling time of 3.2 days (95%CI: 2.3-5.2) and 2.9 days (95%CI: 2.2-4.3), respectively. The net reproduction number showed a decreasing trend starting around February 20-25, 2020 in northern regions. Notably, 5,760 cases were reported among health care workers. Of the 5,541 reported COVID-19 associated deaths, 49% occurred in people aged 80 years or above with an overall crude CFR of 8.8%. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Interpretation The COVID-19 infection in Italy emerged with a clustering onset similar to the one described in Wuhan, China and likewise showed worse outcomes in older males with comorbidities. Initial R0 at 2.96 in Lombardia, explains the high case-load and rapid geographical spread observed. Overall Rt in Italian regions is currently decreasing albeit with large diversities across the country, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Many countries also have incomplete vital registration systems, hampering excess mortality estimation. Here, we fitted a dynamic transmission model to satellite imagery data of cemeteries in Mogadishu, Somalia during 2020 to estimate the date of introduction and other epidemiologic parameters of the early spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in this low-income, crisis-affected setting. Methods: We performed Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting with an age-structured compartmental COVID-19 model to provide median estimates and credible intervals for the date of introduction, the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) and the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) up to August 2020. Results: Under the assumption that excess deaths in Mogadishu March-August 2020 were attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infections, we arrived at median estimates of November-December 2019 for the date of introduction and low R 0 estimates (1.4-1.7) reflecting the slow and early rise and long plateau of excess deaths. The date of introduction, the amount of external seeding, the infection fatality rate (IFR) and the effectiveness of NPIs are correlated parameters and not separately identifiable in a narrow range from deaths data. Nevertheless, to obtain introduction dates no earlier than November 2019 a higher population-wide IFR (\u00e2\u2030\u00a50.7%) had to be assumed than obtained by applying age-specific IFRs from high-income countries to Somalia's age structure. Conclusions: Model fitting of excess mortality data across a range of plausible values of the IFR and the amount of external seeding suggests an early SARS-CoV-2 introduction event may have occurred in Somalia in November-December 2019. Transmissibility in the first epidemic wave was estimated to be lower than in European settings. Alternatively, there was another, unidentified source of sustained excess mortality in Mogadishu from March to August 2020.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We investigate these questions proposing an augmented epidemiological model with an age-structured model, with the population divided into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected and asymptomatic (A), hospitalized (H), infected and symptomatic (I), and recovered individuals (R), to simulate COVID-19 dissemination. The simulations were carried out using six combinations of four types of isolation policies (work restrictions, isolation of the elderly, community distancing and school closures) and four representative fictitious countries generated over alternative demographic transition stage patterns (aged developed, developed, developing and least developed countries). We concluded that the basic reproduction number depends on the age profile and the contact patterns. The aged developed country had the lowest basic reproduction number ($R0=1.74$) due to the low contact rate among individuals, followed by the least developed country ($R0=2.00$), the developing country ($R0=2.43$) and the developed country ($R0=2.64$). Because of these differences in the basic reproduction numbers, the same intervention policies had higher efficiencies in the aged and least developed countries. Of all intervention policies, the reduction in work contacts and community distancing were the ones which produced the highest decrease in the $R0$ value, prevalence, maximum hospitalization demand and fatality rate. The isolation of the elderly was more effective in the developed and aged developed countries. The school closure was the less effective intervention policy, though its effects were not negligible in the least developed and developing countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The model may be of interest for policy makers, as a tool to evaluate different possible future scenarios. We apply the model to the particular case of Italy (as an example of study case), showing different outcomes. We observe that the vaccines may reduce the infections, but they might not be enough for avoiding a new wave, with the current expected vaccination rates in that country, if the control measures are relaxed. Furthermore, a more contagious variant could increase significantly the cases, becoming the most common way of infection. We show how, even with the pandemic cases slowing down (with an effective reproduction number less than 1) and the disease seeming to be under control, the effective reproduction number of just the new variant may be greater than 1 and, eventually, the number of infections would increase towards a new disease wave. Therefore, a rigorous follow-up of the evolution of the number of infections with any potentially more dangerous new variant is of paramount importance at any stage of the pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

On the 14th October England introduced a three-tier system of regional restrictions in an attempt to control the epidemic. This lasted until the 5th November when a new national lockdown was imposed. Tier 1 was the least and tier 3 the most restrictive tiers. We used publicly available data of daily cases by local authority (local government areas) and estimated the reproductive rate (R value) of the epidemic over the previous 14 days at various time points after the imposition of the tier system or where local authorities were moved into higher tiers at time points after reallocation. At day 0 there vas very little difference in the R value between authorities in the different groups but by day 14 the R value in tier 3 authorities had fallen to about 0.9, in tier 2 to about 1.0 and in tier 1 the R value was about 1.5. The restrictions in tier 1 had little impact on transmission and allowed exponential growth in the large majority of authorities. By contrast the epidemic was declining in most tier 3 authorities. In tier 2, exponential growth was being seen in about half of authorities but declining in half. We concluded that the existing three tier system would have been sufficient to control the epidemic if all authorities had been moved out of tier 1 into tier 2 and there had been more rapid identification and transfer of those authorities where the epidemic was increasing out of tier 2 into tier 3. A more restrictive tier than tier 3 may be needed but only by a small number of authorities.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Concerns around the impact on vaccine effectiveness, transmissibility and severity are now driving the public health response to these variants. This paper analyses the patterns of growth in hospitalisations and confirmed cases for novel VOCs by age groups, geography and ethnicity in the context of changing behaviour, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and the UK vaccination programme. We seek to highlight where strategies have been effective and periods that have facilitated the establishment of new variants. DESIGN: We have algorithmically linked the most complete testing and hospitalisation data in England to create a data set of confirmed infections and hospitalisations by SARS-CoV-2 genomic variant. We have used these linked data sets to analyse temporal, geographic and demographic distinctions. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: The setting is England from October 2020 to July 2021. Participants included all COVID-19 tests that included RT-PCR CT gene target data or underwent sequencing and hospitalisations that could be linked to these tests. METHODS: To calculate the instantaneous growth rate for VOCs we have developed a generalised additive model fit to multiple splines and varying day of the week effects. We have further modelled the instantaneous reproduction number R(t) for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.617.2 variants and included a doubly interval censored model to temporally adjust the confirmed variant cases. RESULTS: We observed a clear replacement of the predominant B.1.1.7 by the B.1.617.2 variant without observing sustained exponential growth in other novel variants. Modelled exponential growth of RT PCR gene target triple-positive cases was initially detected in the youngest age groups, although we now observe across all ages a very small doubling time of 10.7 (95% CI 9.1 to 13.2) days and 8 (95% CI 6.9 to 9.1) days for cases and hospitalisations, respectively. We observe that growth in RT PCR gene target triple-positive cases was first detected in the Indian ethnicity group in late February, with a peak of 0.06 (95% CI 0.07 to 0.05) in the instantaneous growth rate, but is now maintained by the white ethnicity groups, observing a doubling time of 6.8 (95% CI 4.9 to 11) days. R(t) analysis indicates a reproduction number advantage of 0.45 for B.1.617.2 relative to B.1.1.7, with the R(t) value peaking at 1.85 for B.1.617.2. CONCLUSIONS: Our results illustrate a clear transmission advantage for the B.1.617.2 variant and the growth in hospitalisations illustrates that this variant is able to maintain exponential growth within age groups that are largely doubly vaccinated. There are concerning signs of intermittent growth in the B.1.351 variant, reaching a 28-day doubling time peak in March 2021, although this variant is presently not showing any evidence of a transmission advantage over B.1.617.2. Step 1b of the UK national lockdown easing was sufficient to precipitate exponential growth in B.1.617.2 cases for most regions and younger adult age groups. The final stages of NPI easing appeared to have a negligible impact on the growth of B.1.617.2 with every region experiencing sustained exponential growth from step 2. Nonetheless, early targeted local NPIs appeared to markedly reduced growth of B.1.617.2. Later localised interventions, at a time of higher prevalence and greater geographic dispersion of this variant, appeared to have a negligible impact on growth.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

As a result, COVID-19 has caused a major threat to global public health. In this paper, we use mathematical modeling to analyze the reported data of COVID-19 cases in Vietnam and study the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions. To achieve this, two models are used to describe the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The first model belongs to the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) type and is used to compute the basic reproduction number. The second model adopts a multi-scale approach which explicitly integrates the movement of each individual. Numerical simulations are conducted to quantify the effects of social distancing measures on the spread of COVID-19 in urban areas of Vietnam. Both models show that the adoption of relaxed social distancing measures reduces the number of infected cases but does not shorten the duration of the epidemic waves. Whereas, more strict measures would lead to the containment of each epidemic wave in one and a half months.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This is a narrative review study based on the studies published related with different aspects of COVID-19. The highest numbers of active cases are in the USA, Brazil, India, Russia, South Africa, as well as Colombia and the disease surveillance system must operate more quickly, timely, effectively, and sensitively in these countries. What is clear is that the SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number is significantly higher than one and its transmission power is extremely high. In general, it can be stated that mortality and fatality risk due to COVID-19 in men, age increase, severity of disease, systemic disease, as well as inadequate access to the sufficient health-care services will increase. There is currently no specific treatment and effective vaccine for COVID-19. The novel coronavirus pandemic is more consistent with the epidemiological triangle model, which emphasizes that the disease is the result of the interaction of three factors of host, agent, and environment. Therefore, prevention and treatment activities should focus on cutting the virus transmission chain. The main way to deal with viral epidemics is prevention. The emerging of this ruthless virus has once again reminded us that communicable diseases should never be underestimated and forgotten. Considering the rapid transmission of COVID-19, the health-care authorities and workers should consider timely detection and safeguards to prevent the transmission to healthy individuals.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "An investigation of tuberculosis progression revealing the role of macrophages apoptosis via sensitivity and bifurcation analysis\nMycobacterium tuberculosis infection features various disease outcomes: clearance, latency, active disease, and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reactivation. Identifying the decisive factors for disease outcomes and progression is crucial to elucidate the macrophages-tuberculosis interaction and provide insights into therapeutic strategies. To achieve this goal, we first model the disease progression as a dynamical shift among different disease outcomes, which are characterized by various steady states of bacterial concentration. The causal mechanisms of steady-state transitions can be the occurrence of transcritical and saddle-node bifurcations, which are induced by slowly changing parameters. Transcritical bifurcation, occurring when the basic reproduction number equals to one, determines whether the infection clears or spreads. Saddle-node bifurcation is the key mechanism to create and destroy steady states. Based on these two steady-state transition mechanisms, we carry out two sample-based sensitivity analyses on transcritical bifurcation conditions and saddle-node bifurcation conditions. The sensitivity analysis results suggest that the macrophage apoptosis rate is the most significant factor affecting the transition in disease outcomes. This result agrees with the discovery that the programmed cell death (apoptosis) plays a unique role in the complex microorganism-host interplay. Sensitivity analysis narrows down the parameters of interest, but cannot answer how these parameters influence the model outcomes. To do this, we employ bifurcation analysis and numerical simulation to unfold various disease outcomes induced by the variation of macrophage apoptosis rate. Our findings support the hypothesis that the regulation mechanism of macrophage apoptosis affects the host immunity against tuberculosis infection and tuberculosis virulence. Moreover, our mathematical results suggest that new treatments and/or vaccines that regulate macrophage apoptosis in combination with weakening bacillary viability and/or promoting adaptive immunity could have therapeutic value.

                "prompt": "Delay-robust Estimation of the Reproduction Number and Comparative Evaluation on Generated Synthetic Data\nThe reproduction number is an indicator of the evolution of an epidemic.Consequently, accurate estimators for this number are essential for decision making in politics. Many estimators use filtered data as input to compensate for fluctuations of reported cases. However, for daily-based estimations, this filtering leads to delays. Some approaches use small window sizes for filtering to overcome this issue. This, in turn, leads to an increased periodic behavior of estimators. To overcome these issues, in the present paper, we introduce an estimator for the reproduction number that uses an acausally filtered number of cases as input, hence avoiding both the periodic behavior and the delay. For the filter size, we suggest using a multiple of one week since reported cases often exhibit a weekly pattern. We show that this approach is more robust against periodicities, and that it does not exhibit any delays in the estimation compared to estimators with smaller filter sizes. Moreover, often it is hard to examine estimators in detail because a ground truth is missing. For analyzing different properties of the estimators, we propose a method to generate synthetic datasets that can be taken as ground truths. Importantly, the synthetic data contains all relevant real-world behavior. Finally, we apply the proposed estimator to the publicly available COVID-19 data for Germany. We compare the proposed estimator to two estimators used by the federal German Robert Koch Institute (RKI). We observe that our estimator is more stable than the benchmarks especially if the reproduction number is close to 1. Based on the observation that the proposed estimator appears more robust, it may be a useful asset when considering governmental interventions.

Multivariate regression revealed that high circulating MT-DNA was an independent risk factor for these outcomes after adjusting for age, sex, and comorbidities. We also found that circulating MT-DNA levels had a similar or superior area under the curve when compared against clinically established measures of inflammation and emerging markers currently of interest as investigational targets for COVID-19 therapy.ConclusionThese results show that high circulating MT-DNA levels are a potential early indicator for poor COVID-19 outcomes.FundingWashington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences COVID-19 Research Program and Washington University Institute of Clinical Translational Sciences (ICTS) NIH grant UL1TR002345.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This study aimed to determine the ongoing trend and upcoming infection status of COVID-19 in county levels of Texas. METHODS: Data were extracted from the following sources: published literature, surveillance, unpublished reports, and websites of Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS), Natality report of Texas and WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. Four-compartment Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removal (SEIR) mathematical model was used to estimate the current trend and future prediction of basic reproduction number and infection case in Texas. Since the basic reproduction number is not sufficient to predict the outbreak, we applied the Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) model to calculate the probability of the COVID-19 outbreak. RESULTS: The estimated mean basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Texas is predicted 2.65 by January 31, 2021. Our model indicated that the third wave might occur at the beginning of May of 2021, which will peak at the end of June 2021. This prediction may come true if the current spreading situation/level persists, i.e., no clinically effective vaccine is available,or this vaccination program fails for some reason in this area.

In this study, we estimated the BRN 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after societal lockdown of Denmark during the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic. Method: We implemented the SEIR dynamical system for disease spread without vital dynamics. The BRN was modulated using a sigmoid function. Model parameters were estimated on number of admitted patients, number of patients in intensive care and cumulative number of deaths using the simulated annealing Monte Carlo algorithm. Results are presented with 95% prediction intervals (PI). Results: We were unable to determine any reliable estimate of the BRN at 7 days following lockdown. The BRN had stabilised at day 14 throughout day 28, with the estimate ranging from 0.95 (95% PI: 0.92-0.98) at day 7 to 0.92 (95% PI: 0.92-0.93) at day 28. We estimated the BRN prior to lockdown to be 3.32 (95% PI: 3.31-3.33). The effect of the lockdown was occurring over a period of a few days centred at March 18th (95% PI: 17th-18th) 2020.

However, a major limitation in establishing such associations is to adequately account for complex disease dynamics, influenced by e.g. significant differences in control measures and testing policies. Another difficulty is appropriately controlling the effects of other potentially important factors, due to both their mutual correlations and a limited dataset. To overcome these difficulties, we will here use the basic reproduction number (R(0)) that we estimate for USA states using non-linear dynamics methods. To account for a large number of predictors (many of which are mutually strongly correlated), combined with a limited dataset, we employ machine-learning methods. Specifically, to reduce dimensionality without complicating the variable interpretation, we employ Principal Component Analysis on subsets of mutually related (and correlated) predictors. Methods that allow feature (predictor) selection, and ranking their importance, are then used, including both linear regressions with regularization and feature selection (Lasso and Elastic Net) and non-parametric methods based on ensembles of weak-learners (Random Forest and Gradient Boost). Through these substantially different approaches, we robustly obtain that PM(2.5) is a major predictor of R(0) in USA states, with corrections from factors such as other pollutants, prosperity measures, population density, chronic disease levels, and possibly racial composition. As a rough magnitude estimate, we obtain that a relative change in R(0), with variations in pollution levels observed in the USA, is typically ~30%, which further underscores the importance of pollution in COVID-19 transmissibility.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Three transmission dynamics models were proposed for this. By separating continuous importation from local transmission and treating imported cases as the source rather than results of local transmission, the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province was estimated in the range from 0.46 to 0.61, well below the critical value of 1.0.

This single-center study retrospectively reviewed all high-risk/suspected cases from January 23, 2020, to February 10, 2020. Epidemiological, clinical feature, and detailed data on all cases were recorded. RESULTS: Practical workflow for the clinical management of dialysis patients, caregivers, and HCP was initiated. A total of 6 high-risk/suspected cases were identified. Female gender, older age, presence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, anuresis, immunocompromised status, hypoalbuminemia, and underweight were noticeable features in these cases.

The rapid airborne transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of a vaccine, calls for active containment measures to avoid the propagation of transmission chains. The best strategy up to date, popularly known as Test-Track-Treat (TTT), consist in testing the population for diagnosis, track the contacts of those infected, and treat by quarantine all these cases. The dynamical process that better describes the combined action of the former mechanisms is that of a contagion process that competes with the spread of the pathogen, cutting off potential contagion pathways. Here we propose a compartmental model that couples the dynamics of the infection with the contact tracing and isolation of cases. We develop an analytical expression for the effective case reproduction number $R_c(t)$ that reveals the role of contact tracing in the mitigation and suppression of the epidemics. We show that there is a trade off between the infection propagation and the isolation of cases. If the isolation is limited to symptomatic individuals only, the incidence curve can be flattened but not bended. However, if contact tracing is applied to asymptomatic individuals too, the strategy can bend the curve and suppress the epidemics. Quantitative results are dependent on the network topology. We quantify, the most important indicator of the effectiveness of contact tracing, namely its capacity to reverse the increasing tendency of the epidemic curve, causing its bending.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The model was applied to analyze the\"car wash operation\"against corruption in Brazil. The model analysis showed that the cost-benefit analysis of crime-susceptible individuals whether the act of bribery is worth or not determined the basic crime reproduction number (threshold); however, the rewarding whistleblowing policies improved the combat to corruption arising a sub-threshold. Some adopted mechanisms to control the Covid-19 pandemic shed light on understanding the\"car wash peration\"and threatens to the fight against corruption. Appropriate coverage of corruption by media, enhancement of laws against white-collar crimes, well-functioning police investigation and court trial, and the rewarding whistleblowing policies inhibited and decreased the corruption.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

These tested groups are often unrepresentative of the wider population and exhibit test positivity rates that are biased upwards compared with the true population prevalence. Such data are routinely used to infer infection prevalence and the effective reproduction number, R(t), which affects public health policy. Here, we describe a causal framework that provides debiased fine-scale spatiotemporal estimates by combining targeted test counts with data from a randomized surveillance study in the United Kingdom called REACT. Our probabilistic model includes a bias parameter that captures the increased probability of an infected individual being tested, relative to a non-infected individual, and transforms observed test counts to debiased estimates of the true underlying local prevalence and R(t). We validated our approach on held-out REACT data over a 7-month period. Furthermore, our local estimates of R(t) are indicative of 1-week- and 2-week-ahead changes in SARS-CoV-2-positive case numbers. We also observed increases in estimated local prevalence and R(t) that reflect the spread of the Alpha and Delta variants. Our results illustrate how randomized surveys can augment targeted testing to improve statistical accuracy in monitoring the spread of emerging and ongoing infectious disease.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The transmission mechanism was analyzed. Methods: We hypothesized that the Xinfadi outbreak was associated with activities of food-trade. Therefore, all the confirmed cases were divided into groups of sellers, buyer, seller transmitted and buyer transmitted. Data for each case were georeferenced and aggregated to the 500m-spaced hexagon grids using geodata and base maps, road networks, urban points of interest from OpenStreetMap. The Xinfadi-related trade activity data were derived using Python crawling scripts. The spatial association of the outbreak was studied with Moran\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s I statistic method and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) coupled Agent-Based Model (ABM). Findings: Of 335 cases reported, 177 (45\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b73%) were sellers who worked for the Market, 83 (23\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b77%) were buyers who visited the Market, and 74 were transmitted by either of the infected buyers or sellers. The Market was the outbreak center, which were spreading along the urban rapid transit lines. The areas with a high incidence were concentrated across neighborhoods in the southwest of Beijing's Fifth Ring Road and the west section of the Fourth Ring of southwestern Beijing, and the west portion of Fuxing Road. The highest number of seller transmission hubs were located in Market neighborhood, however the buyer transmission hubs extended to cover more than three different districts. Our SIR-ABM model analysis suggested that the trade-distancing strategy effectively reduced the R0. The retail shops closure strategy reduced nearly half number of visitors to market. The Buy-local policy option reduced more than 70% infection in total. Interpretation: The Xinfadi outbreak was associated contaminated super food market by people's movements for food-trade, including their interactions in related activities. Therefore, the retails closures and buy-local policy could reduce size of the outbreak and prevent possible outbreak in future.Funding Statement: Ministry of Science and Technology China (Grant number 2018ZX10712001-017 and 2018ZX10712001-018), Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (2018RU010), Chinese Academy (2020-XZ-37) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71603253 and 72074209).Declaration of Interests: All authors declare no competing interests.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We aimed to characterize the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic in Qatar. Methods: A series of epidemiologic studies were conducted including analysis of the national SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing and hospitalization database, community surveys assessing current infection, ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas, serological testing for antibody on blood specimens collected for routine clinical screening/management, national Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19) death registry, and a mathematical model. Results: By July 10, 397,577 individuals had been PCR tested for SARS-CoV-2, of whom 110,986 were positive, a positivity cumulative rate of 27.9% (95% CI: 27.8-28.1%). PCR positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs in a national community survey (May 6-7) including 1,307 participants was 14.9% (95% CI: 11.5-19.0%); 58.5% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. Across 448 ad-hoc PCR testing campaigns in workplaces and residential areas including 26,715 individuals, pooled mean PCR positivity was 15.6% (95% CI: 13.7-17.7%). SARS-CoV-2 antibody prevalence was 24.0% (95% CI: 23.3-24.6%) in 32,970 residual clinical blood specimens. Antibody prevalence was only 47.3% (95% CI: 46.2-48.5%) in those who had at least one PCR positive result, but it was 91.3% (95% CI: 89.5-92.9%) among those who were PCR positive >3 weeks before serology testing. There were substantial differences in exposure to infection by nationality and sex, reflecting risk differentials between the CMW and urban populations. As of July 5, case severity rate, based on the WHO severity classification, was 3.4% and case fatality rate was 1.4 per 1,000 persons. Model-estimated daily number of infections and active-infection prevalence peaked at 31,040 and 8.0%, respectively, on May 20 and May 21. Attack rate (ever infection) was estimated at 61.3% on July 12. R0 ranged between 1.45-1.68 throughout the epidemic. Rt was estimated at 0.70 on June 15, which was hence set as onset date for easing of restrictions. Age was by far the strongest predictor of severe, critical, or fatal infection. Conclusions: Qatar has experienced a large SARS-CoV-2 epidemic that is rapidly declining, apparently due to exhaustion of susceptibles. The epidemic demonstrated a classic susceptible-infected-recovered SIR dynamics with a rather stable R0 of about 1.6. The young demographic structure of the population, in addition to a resourced public health response, yielded a milder disease burden and lower mortality than elsewhere.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The demographic characteristics, exposure history, dates of illness onset and dates of confirmed diagnosis were collected from the data of 24 family clusters from Beijing. The characteristics of the cases and the estimated key epidemiologic time-to-event distributions were described. The basic reproductive number (R(0)) was calculated. Among 89 confirmed COVID-19 patients from 24 family clusters, the median age was 38.0 years and 43.8% were male. The median of incubation period was 5.08 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.17\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01536.21).

The median of onset-to-care-seeking days and the median of onset-to-hospital admission days were significantly reduced after 23 January 2020, which implied the enhanced public health awareness among families. With epidemic containment measures in place, the results can inform health authorities about possible extent of epidemic transmission within families.

However, a substantial gap in knowledge still exists regarding differing temporal pattern and potential of transmission of ZIKV in different regions of the world. METHODS: We use a phenomenological model to ascertain the temporal patterns and transmission potential of ZIKV in various countries/territories, by fitting the model to Zika case data from Yap Island and French Polynesia in the Oceania region and 11 countries/territories with confirmed case data, namely, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Guatemala, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico, Saint Martin, and Suriname, to pinpoint the waves of infections in each country/territory and to estimate the respective basic reproduction number R(0). RESULTS: Six of these time series datasets resulted in statistically significant model fit of at least one wave of reported cases, namely that of French Polynesia, Colombia, Puerto Rico, Guatemala, Suriname and Saint Martin. However, only Colombia and Guatemala exhibited two waves of cases while the others had only one wave. Temporal patterns of the second wave in Colombia and the single wave in Suriname are very similar, with the respective turning points separated by merely a week. Moreover, the mean estimates of R(0) for Colombia, Guatemala and Suriname, all land-based populations, range between 1.05 and 1.75, while the corresponding mean estimates for R(0) of island populations in French Polynesia, Puerto Rico and Saint Martin are significantly lower with a range of 5.70\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01536.89. We also fit the Richards model to Zika case data from six main archipelagos in French Polynesia, suggesting the outbreak in all six island populations occurred during the same time, albeit with different peak time, with mean R(0) range of 3.09\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01535.05. DISCUSSION: Using the same modeling methodology, in this study we found a significant difference between transmissibility (as quantified by R(0)) in island populations as opposed to land-based countries/territories, possibly suggesting an important role of geographic heterogeneity in the spread of vector-borne diseases and its future course, which requires further monitoring.

During the epidemic, incidence data were collected and published at increasing resolution. To monitor the epidemic as it spread within and between districts, we develop an analysis method that exploits the full spatiotemporal resolution of the data by combining a local model for time-varying effective reproduction numbers with a gravity-type model for spatial dispersion of the infection. We test this method in simulations and apply it to the weekly incidences of confirmed and probable cases per district up to June 2015, as reported by the World Health Organization. Our results indicate that, of the newly infected cases, only a small percentage, between 4% and 10%, migrates to another district, and a minority of these migrants, between 0% and 23%, leave their country. The epidemics in the three countries are found to be similar in estimated effective reproduction numbers, and in the probability of importing infection into a district. The countries might have played different roles in cross-border transmissions, although a sensitivity analysis suggests that this could also be related to underreporting. The spatiotemporal analysis method can exploit available longitudinal incidence data at different geographical locations to monitor local epidemics, determine the extent of spatial spread, reveal the contribution of local and imported cases, and identify sources of introductions in uninfected areas. With good quality data on incidence, this data-driven method can help to effectively control emerging infections.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Hygiene and educational campaign programmes have been identified to be potent public health interventions that can curtail the spread of the highly infectious disease. In order to verify this claim quantitatively, we propose and analyze a non-linear mathematical model to investigate the effect of healthy sanitation and awareness on the transmission dynamics of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) prevalence. Rigorous stability analysis of the model equilibrium points was performed to ascertain the basic reproduction number R(0), a threshold that determines whether or not a disease dies out of the population.

During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, policy makers and public health officials are using Rt to assess the effectiveness of interventions and to inform policy. However, estimation of Rt from available data presents several challenges, with critical implications for the interpretation of the course of the pandemic. The purpose of this document is to summarize these challenges, illustrate them with examples from synthetic data, and, where possible, make recommendations. For near real-time estimation of Rt, we recommend the approach of Cori and colleagues, which uses data from before time t and empirical estimates of the distribution of time between infections. Methods that require data from after time t, such as Wallinga and Teunis, are conceptually and methodologically less suited for near real-time estimation, but may be appropriate for retrospective analyses of how individuals infected at different time points contributed to the spread. We advise caution when using methods derived from the approach of Bettencourt and Ribeiro, as the resulting Rt estimates may be biased if the underlying structural assumptions are not met. Two key challenges common to all approaches are accurate specification of the generation interval and reconstruction of the time series of new infections from observations occurring long after the moment of transmission. Naive approaches for dealing with observation delays, such as subtracting delays sampled from a distribution, can introduce bias. We provide suggestions for how to mitigate this and other technical challenges and highlight open problems in Rt estimation.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Since, then, the epidemic growth trajectory was slow before registering an explosion of cases due to local cluster transmissions. Methods: We estimated the growth rate and doubling time of SARS-CoV-2 for India and high burden states using crowdsourced time series data. Further, we also estimated the Basic Reproductive Number (R0) and Time-dependent Reproductive number (Rt) using serial intervals from the data. We compared the R0 estimated from five different methods and R0 from SB was further used in the analysis. We modified standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) models to SIR/Death (SIRD) model to accommodate deaths using R0 with the sequential Bayesian method for simulation in SIRD models. Results: On average, 2.8 individuals were infected by an index case. The mean serial interval was 3.9 days. The R0 estimated from different methods ranged from 1.43 to 1.85. The mean time to recovery was 14 ?\u00b1 5.3 days. The daily epidemic growth rate of India was 0.16 [95% CI; 0.14, 0.17] with a doubling time of 4.30 days [95% CI; 3.96, 4.70]. From the SIRD model, it can be deduced that the peak of SARS-CoV-2 in India will be around mid-July to early August 2020 with around 12.5% of the population likely to be infected at the peak time. Conclusion: The pattern of spread of SARS-CoV-2 in India is suggestive of community transmission. There is a need to increase funds for infectious disease research and epidemiologic studies. All the current gains may be reversed if air travel and social mixing resume rapidly. For the time being, these must be resumed only in a phased manner and should be back to normal levels only after we are prepared to deal with the disease with efficient tools like vaccines or medicine.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this work, we propose a mathematical framework for optimal stabilizing vaccine allocation, where our goal is to send the infections to zero as soon as possible with a fixed number of vaccine doses. This framework allows us to efficiently compute the optimal vaccine allocation policy for general epidemic spread models including SIS/SIR/SEIR and a new model of COVID-19 transmissions. By fitting the real data in New York State to our framework, we found that the optimal stabilizing vaccine allocation policy suggests offering vaccines priority to locations where there are more susceptible people and where the residents spend longer time outside the home. Besides, we found that offering vaccines priority to young adults (20-29) and middle-age adults (20-44) can minimize the cumulative infected cases and the death cases. Moreover, we compared our method with five age-stratified strategies in \\cite{bubar2021model} based on their epidemics model. We also found it's better to offer vaccine priorities to young people to curb the disease and minimize the deaths when the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is moderately above one, which describes the most world during COVID-19.

The effective screening of suspected cases in the healthcare setting is therefore necessary, enabling the early identification and prompt isolation of cases for epidemic containment. We aimed to assess the cost and health outcomes of an extended screening strategy, implemented in Singapore on 07 February 2020, which maximizes case identification in the public healthcare system. METHODS: We explored the effects of the expanded screening criteria which allow clinicians to isolate and investigate patients presenting with undifferentiated fever or respiratory symptoms or chest x-ray abnormalities. We formulated a cost appraisal framework which evaluated the treatment costs averted from the prevention of secondary transmission in the hospital setting, as determined by a branching process infection model, and compared these to the costs of the additional testing required to meet the criteria. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, an R0 of 2.5 and incubation period of 4 days, an estimated 239 (95% CI: 201-287) cases could be averted over 150 days within the hospital setting through ESC. A corresponding $2.36 (2-2.85) million USD in costs could be averted with net cost savings of $124,000 (95% CI: -334,000 to 516,000). In the sensitivity analyses, when positive identification rates (PIR) were above 7%, regardless of R0 and incubation period, all scenarios were cost-saving. CONCLUSION: The expanded screening criteria can help to identify and promptly isolate positive COVID cases in a cost-saving manner or within acceptable cost margins where the costs incurred from the testing of negative patients could be negated by the averted costs. Outbreak control must be sustainable and effective; the proposed screening criteria should be considered to mitigate nosocomial transmission risk within healthcare facilities.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Real-time data is noisy and very often hampered by systematic errors in reporting. Detailed epidemic models may contain a large number of empirical parameters, which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy. In this paper, we show that the cumulative number of deaths can be regarded as a master variable, and the parameters of the epidemic such as the basic reproduction number, the size of the susceptible population, and the infection rate can be determined. In the SIR model, we derive an explicit single variable differential equation for the evolution of the cumulative number of fatalities. We show that the epidemic in Spain, Italy, and Hubei Province, China follows this master equation closely. We discuss the relationship with the logistic growth model, and we show that it is a good approximation when the basic reproduction number is less than $2.3$. This condition is valid for the outbreak in Hubei, but not for the outbreaks in Spain, Italy, and New York. The difference is in the shorter infectious period in China, probably due to the separation policy of the infected. For more complex models, with more internal variables, such as the SEIR model, the equations derived from the SIR model remain valid approximately, due to the separation of timescales.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Understanding their possible effect is key to prevent future disease spread. Using a modelling approach, this study intends to measure the impact of the COVID-19 Portuguese vaccination strategy on the effective reproduction number and explore three scenarios for vaccine effectiveness waning. Namely, the no-immunity-loss, 1-year and 3-years of immunity duration scenarios. We adapted an age-structured SEIR deterministic model and used Portuguese hospitalisation data for the model calibration. Results show that, although the Portuguese vaccination plan had a substantial impact in reducing overall transmission, it might not be sufficient to control disease spread. A significant vaccination coverage of those above 5 years old, a vaccine effectiveness against disease of at least 80% and softer non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as mask usage and social distancing, would be necessary to control disease spread in the worst scenario considered. The immunity duration scenario of 1-year displays a resurgence of COVID-19 hospitalisations by the end of 2021, the same is observed in 3-year scenario although with a lower magnitude. The no-immunity-loss scenario presents a low increase in hospitalisations. In both the 1-year and 3-year scenarios, a vaccination boost of those above 65 years old would result in a 53% and 38% peak reduction of non-ICU hospitalisations, respectively. These results suggest that NPIs should not be fully phased-out but instead be combined with a fast booster vaccination strategy to reduce healthcare burden.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Traditional individual surveillance testing via nasal swabs and/or saliva is among the measures that colleges are pursuing to reduce the spread of the virus on campus. Additionally, some colleges are testing wastewater on their campuses for signs of infection, which can provide an early warning signal for campuses to locate COVID-positive individuals. However, a representation of wastewater surveillance has not yet been incorporated into epidemiological models for college campuses, nor has the efficacy of wastewater screening been evaluated relative to traditional individual surveillance testing, within the structure of these models. Here, we implement a new model component for wastewater surveillance within an established epidemiological model for college campuses. We use a hypothetical residential university to evaluate the efficacy of wastewater surveillance for maintaining low infection rates. We find that wastewater sampling with a 1-day lag to initiate individual screening tests, plus completing the subsequent tests within a 4-day period can keep overall infections within 5% of the infection rates seen with traditional individual surveillance testing. Our results also indicate that wastewater surveillance can effectively reduce the number of false positive cases by identifying subpopulations for surveillance testing where infectious individuals are more likely to be found. Through a Monte Carlo risk analysis, we find that surveillance testing that relies solely on wastewater sampling can be fragile against scenarios with high viral reproductive numbers and high rates of infection of campus community members by outside sources. These results point to the practical importance of additional surveillance measures to limit the spread of the virus on campus and the necessity of a proactive response to the initial signs of outbreak.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Our time-dependent SIR method is better than the traditional static SIR model as it can adapt to the change of contagious disease control policies such as city lockdowns. Moreover, it is also more robust than the direct estimation of the number of confirmed cases, as a sudden change of the definition of the number of confirmed cases might result in a spike of the number of new cases. Using the data set provided by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (NHC) [2], we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed cases are less than $3\\%$ except the day when the definition of the number of confirmed cases is changed. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission rate is less than the recovering rate, is predicted to be Feb. 17, 2020. After that day, the basic reproduction number, known as the $R_0(t)$ value, is less than $1$ if the current contagious disease control policies are maintained in China. In that case, the total number of confirmed cases is predicted to be less than $80,000$ cases in China under our deterministic model.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Could the ambient higher temperature decrease the transmissibility of COVID-19 in China?\nBACKGROUND: Existing literatures demonstrated that meteorological factors could be of importance in affecting the spread patterns of the respiratory infectious diseases. However, how ambient temperature may influence the transmissibility of COVID-19 remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We explore the association between ambient temperature and transmissibility of COVID-19 in different regions across China. METHODS: The surveillance data on COVID-19 and meteorological factors were collected from 28 provincial level regions in China, and estimated the instantaneous reproductive number (R(t)). The generalized additive model was used to assess the relationship between mean temperature and R(t). RESULTS: There were 12745 COVID-19 cases collected in the study areas. We report the effect of temperature on R(t) is likely to be negative but not of statistical significance, which holds for most of included regions except for those in North China. CONCLUSIONS: We found little statistical evidence for that the higher temperature may reduce the transmissibility of COVID-19. Since intensive control measures against the COVID-19 epidemics were implemented in China, we acknowledge this may impact the underlying effect size estimation, and thus cautiousness should be taken when interpreting our findings.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: We utilize the multi-phase Richards model to fit the weekly cumulative pH1N1 epidemiological data (numbers of confirmed cases and hospitalizations) as well as the daily number of classes suspended under a unique \"325\" partial school closing policy in Taiwan, in order to pinpoint the turning points of the summer and fall/winter waves, and to estimate the reproduction numbers R for each wave. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that the summer wave had slowed down by early September when schools reopened for fall. However, a second fall/winter wave began in late September, approximately 4 weeks after the school reopened, peaking at about 2-3 weeks after the start of the mass immunization campaign in November. R is estimated to be in the range of 1.04-1.27 for the first wave, and between 1.01-1.05 for the second wave. CONCLUSIONS: Transmissibility of the summer wave in Taiwan during July-early September, as measured by R, was lower than that of the earlier spring outbreak in North America and Europe, as well as that of the winter outbreak in Southern Hemisphere. Furthermore, transmissibility during fall/winter in Taiwan was noticeably lower than that of the summer, which is attributable to population-level immunity acquired from the earlier summer wave and also to the intervention measures that were implemented prior to and during the fall/winter wave.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this study, we analysed the efficiency of various intervention strategies to prevent infection by the virus, SARS-CoV-2, using an agent-based SEIIR model, in the fully urbanised city of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China. Shortening the duration from symptom onset to hospital admission, quarantining recent arrivals from Hubei Province, and letting symptomatic individuals stay at home were found to be the three most important interventions to reduce the risk of infection in Shenzhen. The ideal time window for a mandatory quarantine of arrivals from Hubei Province was between 10 January and January 17, 2020, while the ideal time window for local intervention strategies was between 15 and 22 January. The risk of infection could have been reduced by 50% if all symptomatic individuals had immediately gone to hospital for isolation, and by 35% if a 14-day quarantine for arrivals from Hubei Province had been introduced one week earlier. Intervention strategies implemented in Shenzhen were effective, and the spread of infection would be controlled even if the initial basic reproduction number had doubled.

To investigate district-level transmissibility of EVD, we applied a statistical modelling approach to estimate the basic reproduction number (R(0)) for each affected district and each country using weekly incident case numbers. We estimated growth rates during the early exponential phase of the outbreak using exponential regression of the case counts on the first eight weeks since onset. To take into account the heterogeneity between and within countries, we fitted a mixed effects model and calculated R(0) based on the predicted individual growth rates and the reported serial interval distribution.

We propose a software simulation method centered on in what manner a virus spreads inside a closed space. This approach required the implementation of a simplified model of human behavior, while considering the factors that influence the rate of transmission between individuals. Agent-based simulation allowed us to identify different control and prevention means, which are efficient in reducing the natural evolution of a pandemic. The results of the analysis offered insight into the rate of spread and human behavior, or habits that led to a significant increase in the total number of infected agents. Recent literature discussed the simulation of disease spread among the inhabitants of larger areas or studied the way that the pathogen can be spread from person to person through droplets containing the virus.

The impact of bubbling on COVID-19 transmission is challenging to quantify because of the complex social structures involved. Methods: We developed a network description of households in the UK, using the configuration model to link households. We explored the impact of bubbling scenarios by joining together households of various sizes. For each bubbling scenario, we calculated the percolation threshold, that is, the number of connections per individual required for a giant component to form, numerically and theoretically. We related the percolation threshold to the household reproduction number. Results: We find that bubbling scenarios in which single-person households join with another household has a minimal impact on network connectivity and transmission potential. Ubiquitous scenarios where all households form a bubble are likely to lead to extensive transmission that is hard to control. The impact of plausible scenarios, with variable uptake and heterogeneous bubble sizes, can be mitigated with reduced numbers of contacts outside the household. Conclusions: Bubbling of households comes at an increased risk of transmission, however under certain circumstances risks can be modest and could be balanced by other changes in behaviours.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Using combinations of meta-population models SEAIIRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Asymptomatic-Infected-Recovered-Diseased) which describes the disease dynamics in the different localities, with movement data that accounts for the number of commuters between units and statistical inference algorithms could be an effective approach to both nowcast and forecast the number of cases and deaths in the country. Here we used an iterated filtering (IF) framework to fit the parameters of our model to the reported data across municipalities from march to late October in locations with more than 50 reported deaths and cases historically. Since the model is high dimensional (6 state variable by municipality) inference on those parameters is highly non-trivial, so we used an Ensemble-Adjustment-Kalman-Filter (EAKF) to estimate time variable system states and parameters. Our results show that the model is capable of capturing the evolution of the outbreak in the country and providing estimates of the epidemiological parameters in time. These estimates could become the base for planning future interventions as well as evaluate the impact of NPIs on the effective reproductive number ($mathcal{R}_{eff}$) and the key epidemiological parameters, such as the contact rate or the reporting rate. Our approach demonstrates that real-time, publicly available ensemble forecasts can provide robust short-term predictions of reported COVID-19 deaths in Colombia. This model has the potential to be used as a forecasting and prediction tool to evaluate disease dynamics and to develop a real time surveillance system for management and control.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

By setting the end of containment as the day when hospital capacity is reached, numerical simulations showed that the duration can be reduced (up to only 39 days for France if the capacity is 1000 patients).

Influenza studies have shown that influenza viruses survive longer on surfaces or in droplets in cold and dry air, thus increasing the likelihood of subsequent transmission. A similar hypothesis has been postulated for the transmission of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2. It is important to propose methodologies to understand the effects of environmental factors on this ongoing outbreak to support decision-making pertaining to disease control. Here, we examine the spatial variability of the basic reproductive numbers of COVID-19 across provinces and cities in China and show that environmental variables alone cannot explain this variability. Our findings suggest that changes in weather (i.e., increase of temperature and humidity as spring and summer months arrive in the Northern Hemisphere) will not necessarily lead to declines in case counts without the implementation of drastic public health interventions.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, early forecasts are generally unreliable as little information is available in the first few incidence data points. Here, we show how past Aedes-transmitted epidemics help improve these predictions. The approach was applied to the 2015\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 Zika virus epidemics in three islands of the French West Indies, with historical data including other Aedes-transmitted diseases (chikungunya and Zika) in the same and other locations. Hierarchical models were used to build informative a priori distributions on the reproduction ratio and the reporting rates. The accuracy and sharpness of forecasts improved substantially when these a priori distributions were used in models for prediction. For example, early forecasts of final epidemic size obtained without historical information were 3.3 times too high on average (range: 0.2 to 5.8) with respect to the eventual size, but were far closer (1.1 times the real value on average, range: 0.4 to 1.5) using information on past CHIKV epidemics in the same places. Likewise, the 97.5% upper bound for maximal incidence was 15.3 times (range: 2.0 to 63.1) the actual peak incidence, and became much sharper at 2.4 times (range: 1.3 to 3.9) the actual peak incidence with informative a priori distributions. Improvements were more limited for the date of peak incidence and the total duration of the epidemic. The framework can adapt to all forecasting models at the early stages of emerging Aedes-transmitted outbreaks.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Here, we identify epidemiological traits of self-limited infections (i.e. infections with an effective reproduction number satisfying [Image: see text]) that correlate with transmissibility. Our analysis is based on a branching process model that permits statistical comparison of both the strength and heterogeneity of transmission for two distinct types of cases. Our approach provides insight into a variety of scenarios, including the transmission of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian peninsula, measles in North America, pre-eradication smallpox in Europe, and human monkeypox in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When applied to chain size data for MERS-CoV transmission before 2014, our method indicates that despite an apparent trend towards improved control, there is not enough statistical evidence to indicate that [Image: see text] has declined with time. Meanwhile, chain size data for measles in the United States and Canada reveal statistically significant geographic variation in [Image: see text], suggesting that the timing and coverage of national vaccination programs, as well as contact tracing procedures, may shape the size distribution of observed infection clusters. Infection source data for smallpox suggests that primary cases transmitted more than secondary cases, and provides a quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of control interventions. Human monkeypox, on the other hand, does not show evidence of differential transmission between animals in contact with humans, primary cases, or secondary cases, which assuages the concern that social mixing can amplify transmission by secondary cases. Lastly, we evaluate surveillance requirements for detecting a change in the human-to-human transmission of monkeypox since the cessation of cross-protective smallpox vaccination. Our studies lay the foundation for future investigations regarding how infection source, vaccination status or other putative transmissibility traits may affect self-limited transmission.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) to slow down the spread. This study proposes an agent-based model that simulates the spread of COVID-19 among the inhabitants of a city. The agent-based model can be accommodated for any location by integrating parameters specific to the city. The simulation gives the number of total COVID-19 cases. Considering each person as an agent susceptible to COVID-19, the model causes infected individuals to transmit the disease via various actions performed every hour. The model is validated by comparing the simulation to the real data of Ford County, KS, USA. Different interventions, including contact tracing, are applied on a scaled-down version of New York City, USA, and the parameters that lead to a controlled epidemic are determined. Our experiments suggest that contact tracing via smartphones with more than 60% of the population owning a smartphone combined with city-wide lockdown results in the effective reproduction number (R t ) to fall below 1 within 3 weeks of intervention. For 75% or more smartphone users, new infections are eliminated, and the spread is contained within 3 months of intervention. Contact tracing accompanied with early lockdown can suppress the epidemic growth of COVID-19 completely with sufficient smartphone owners. In places where it is difficult to ensure a high percentage of smartphone ownership, tracing only emergency service providers during a lockdown can go a long way to contain the spread.

Superspreading is caused primarily by heterogeneity in social contact rates, and therefore represents an opportunity for targeting surveillance and control via consideration of social network topologies, particularly in resource-limited settings. Yet, it remains unclear how to implement such surveillance and control, espeically when network data is unavailable. MethodsWe evaluated the efficiency of a testing strategy that targeted potential superspreading individuals based on their degree centrality on a social network compared to a random testing strategy in the context of low testing capacity. We simulated SARS-CoV-2 dynamics on two contact networks from rural Madagascar and measured the epidemic duration, infection burden, and tests needed to end the epidemics. In addition, we examined the robustness of this approach when individuals true degree centralities were unknown and were instead estimated via readily-available socio-demographic variables. FindingsTargeted testing of potential superspreaders reduced the infection burden by 40-63% at low testing capacities, while requiring between 45-78% fewer tests compared to random testing. Further, targeted testing remained more efficient when the true network topology was unknown and prioritization was based on socio-demographic characteristics. InterpretationIncorporating social network topology into epidemic control strategies is an effective public health strategy for health systems suffering from low testing capacity and can be implemented via socio-demographic proxies when social networks are unknown.

In this study we systematically generate and compare 30-day ahead forecasts using previously validated growth models based on mortality trends from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation for Mexico and Mexico City in near real-time. Moreover, we estimate reproduction numbers for SARS-CoV-2 based on the methods that rely on genomic data as well as case incidence data. Subsequently, functional data analysis techniques are utilized to analyze the shapes of COVID-19 growth rate curves at the state level to characterize the spatiotemporal transmission patterns of SARS-CoV-2. The early estimates of the reproduction number for Mexico were estimated between R(t) ~1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.3 from the genomic and case incidence data. Moreover, the mean estimate of R(t) has fluctuated around ~1.0 from late July till end of September 2020. The spatial analysis characterizes the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 into four groups with distinct epidemic trajectories based on epidemic growth rates. Our results show that the sequential mortality forecasts from the GLM and Richards model predict a downward trend in the number of deaths for all thirteen forecast periods for Mexico and Mexico City. However, the sub-epidemic and IHME models perform better predicting a more realistic stable trajectory of COVID-19 mortality trends for the last three forecast periods (09/21-10/21, 09/28-10/27, 09/28-10/27) for Mexico and Mexico City.

When a significant proportion of the population is already immune, this becomes (n - 1/R0)/ {epsilon}, where n is the proportion of non-immune individuals. A similar equation can be obtained for short-term immunization thresholds(qt), which are dependent on Rt. qs for most countries are between 60-75% of the population. Current qt for most countries are between 20-40%.

Most countries with significant outbreaks have introduced social distancing or \"lockdown\" measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how and to what extent these measures can be lifted.Publicly available data on daily numbers of newly confirmed cases and mortality were used to fit regression models estimating trajectories, doubling times and the reproduction number (R0) of the disease, before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 21 May 2020, and were sufficient for analysis in 89 countries.The estimates of R0 before lockdown based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published: between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions: R0 0.76 (95% CI 0.72-0.82) based on cases, and 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.80) based on mortality.Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increased freedom and economic activity.

Although a superspreader is an individual who undergoes more viral shedding and transmission than others, it appears likely that environmental factors have a substantial role in SSEs. We categorise SSEs into two distinct groups: 'societal' and 'isolated' SSEs.

This enables more focussed and productive control of the current pandemic and future pandemics, especially as countries and regions ease lockdown restrictions. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 'Societal' SSEs pose a significant threat as members of the event are free to mingle and can infect individuals in the outside community. On the other hand, 'isolated' SSEs can be effectively quarantined as only a few individuals can transmit the virus from the isolated community to the outside community, therefore lowering further societal infection.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Furthermore, we estimated that 87% infections (lower bound: 53%) were unascertained, potentially including asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic cases. The probability of resurgence was 0.33 and 0.06 based on models with 87% and 53% infections unascertained, respectively, assuming all interventions were lifted after 14 days of no ascertained infections.

Therefore, this study aimed to estimate the reproductive numbers (R) for each epidemic stage to analyze the effects of the preventive measures and to predict the COVID-19 transmission trends. METHODS: We estimated the transmission rates for each epidemic stage by fitting a COVID-19 transmission model, based on a deterministic mathematical model, to the data on confirmed cases. The effects of preventive measures such as social distancing by time period were analyzed, and the size and trends of future COVID-19 outbreaks were estimated. RESULTS: The value of R was 3.53 from February18, 2020 to February 28, 2020, and the mean R reduced to 0.45 from March 14, 2020 to April 29, 2020, but it significantly increased to 2.69 from April 30, 2020 to May13, 2020 and it was maintained at 1.03 from May 14, 2020 to July 23, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: According to the estimated R, it had fallen to below 1 and was maintained at that level owing to the isolation of infected persons by the public health authorities and social distancing measures followed by the general public. Then, the estimated R increased rapidly as the contact among individuals increased during the long holiday period from April 30, 2020 to May 5, 2020.

The basic reproductive ratio (R0) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of contacts through which the disease can spread - with this network determined by socio-demographics including age-structure and household composition. Here we focus on the age-structured transmission within the population, using data from China to inform age-dependent susceptibility and synthetic age-mixing matrices to inform the contact network. This allows us to determine the country-specific basic reproductive ratio as a multiplicative scaling of the value from China.

Our method to estimate the reproduction number using Bayesian inference with time-dependent priors enhances previous approaches by considering a dynamic prior continuously updated as restrictive measures and comportments within the society evolve. In addition, to allow direct comparison between reproduction number and introduction of public health measures in a specific country, the infection dates are inferred from daily confirmed cases and confirmed death. The evolution of this reproduction number in combination with the stringency index is analyzed on 31 European countries. We show that most countries required tough state interventions with a stringency index equal to 79.6 out of 100 to reduce their reproduction number below one and control the progression of the pandemic. In addition, we show a direct correlation between the time taken to introduce restrictive measures and the time required to contain the spread of the pandemic with a median time of 8 days. This analysis is validated by comparing the excess deaths and the time taken to implement restrictive measures.

The mathematical modeling approach is one of the considerable tools to study the disease spreading pattern. In this article, we develop a fractional order epidemic model for COVID-19 in the sense of Caputo operator. The model is based on the effective contacts among the population and environmental impact to analyze the disease dynamics. The fractional models are comparatively better in understanding the disease outbreak and providing deeper insights into the infectious disease dynamics. We first consider the classical integer model studied in recent literature and then we generalize it by introducing the Caputo fractional derivative. Furthermore, we explore some fundamental mathematical analysis of the fractional model, including the basic reproductive number R 0 and equilibria stability utilizing the Routh-Hurwitz and the Lyapunov function approaches. Besides theoretical analysis, we also focused on the numerical solution. To simulate the model, we use the well-known generalized Adams-Bashforth Moulton Scheme.

We ascertained IgG levels across a single US metropolitan site, Chicago, from June 2020 through December 2020. METHODS: Participants (n = 7935) were recruited through electronic advertising and received materials for a self-sampled dried-blood spot assay through the mail or a minimal contact in-person method. IgG against the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was measured using an established highly sensitive and highly specific assay. RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence was 17.9%, with no significant difference between method of contact. Only 2.5% of participants reported having had a diagnosis of COVID-19 based on virus detection, consistent with a 7-fold greater exposure to SARS-CoV-2 measured by serology than that detected by viral testing. The range of IgG level observed in seropositive participants from this community survey overlapped with the range of IgG levels associated with COVID-19 cases having a documented positive PCR test. From a subset of those who participated in repeat testing, half of seropositive individuals retained detectable antibodies for 3 to 4 months. CONCLUSION: Quantitative IgG measurements with a highly specific and sensitive assay indicated more widespread exposure to SARS-CoV-2 than observed by viral testing. The range of IgG concentrations produced from these asymptomatic exposures was similar to IgG levels occurring after documented nonhospitalized COVID-19, which were considerably lower than those produced from hospitalized COVID-19 cases. The differing ranges of IgG response, coupled with the rate of decay of antibodies, may influence response to subsequent viral exposure and vaccine.

We hypothesize that in The Netherlands the same environmental factors and mobility trends that are associated with the seasonality of flu-like illnesses are predictors of COVID-19 seasonality as well. MethodsWe used meteorological, pollen/hay fever and mobility data from the Netherlands with its 17.4 million inhabitants. For the reproduction number of COVID-19 (Rt), we used data from the Dutch State Institute for Public Health. This Rt metric is a daily estimate that is based on positive COVID-19 tests in the Netherlands in hospitals and municipalities. For all datasets we selected the overlapping period of COVID-19 and the first allergy season: from February 17, 2020 till September 21, 2020 (total number of measurements: n = 218), the end of pollen season. Backward stepwise multiple linear regression was used to develop an environmental prediction model of the Rt of COVID-19. Next, we studied whether adding mobility trends to an environmental model improved the predictive power. ResultsBy means of stepwise backward multiple linear regression four highly significant (p value < 0.01) predictive factors are selected in our combined model: temperature, solar radiation, hay fever incidence, and mobility to indoor recreation locations. Our combined model explains 87.5% of the variance of Rt of COVID-19 and has a good and highly significant fit: F(4, 213) = 374.2, p-value < 0.00001. The combined model had a better overall predictive performance compared to a solely environmental model, which still explains 77.3% of the variance of Rt, and a good and highly significant fit: F(4, 213) = 181.3, p < 0.00001. ConclusionsWe conclude that the combined mobility and environmental model can adequately predict the seasonality of COVID-19 in a country with a temperate climate like the Netherlands. In this model higher solar radiation, higher temperature and hay fever are related to lower COVID-19 reproduction, and mobility to indoor recreation locations with increased COVID-19 spread.

In this rare disease local control is highly dependent on the extent of surgery. Further treatment options are urgently needed. Re-iradiation in combination with localized hyperthermia should be considered for adjuvant and definitive treatment of nonresectable radiation-associated angiosarcomas. The presented hypofractionated re-irradiation schedule with 5 \u00c3\u0192\u00e2\u20ac\u201d 4 Gy once per week immediately following wIRA-hyperthermia is a promising option to further reduce the radiation dose recommended so far. This could reduce side effects without compromising local control. ABSTRACT: Background: Radiation-associated angiosarcoma of the breast (RAASB) is a rare, challenging disease, with surgery being the accepted basic therapeutic approach. In contrast, the role of adjuvant and systemic therapies is a subject of some controversy. Local recurrence rates reported in the literature are mostly heterogeneous and are highly dependent on the extent of surgery. In cases of locally recurrent or unresectable RAASB, prognosis is very poor. Methods: We retrospectively report on 10 consecutive RAASB patients, most of them presenting with locally recurrent or unresectable RAASB, which were treated with thermography-controlled water-filtered infrared-A (wIRA) superficial hyperthermia (HT) immediately followed by re-irradiation (re-RT). Patients with RAASB were graded based on their tumor extent before onset of radiotherapy (RT). Results: We recorded a local control (LC) rate dependent on tumor extent ranging from a high LC rate of 100% (two of two patients) in the adjuvant setting with an R0 or R2 resection to a limited LC rate of 33% (one of three patients) in patients with inoperable, macroscopic tumor lesions. Conclusion: Combined HT and re-RT should be considered as an option (a) for adjuvant treatment of RAASB, especially in cases with positive resection margins and after surgery of local recurrence (LR), and (b) for definitive treatment of unresectable RAASB.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Population-scale testing can suppress the spread of COVID-19\nWe propose an additional intervention that would contribute to the control of the COVID-19 pandemic, offer more protection for people working in essential jobs, and help guide an eventual reopening of society. The intervention is based on: (1) testing every individual (2) repeatedly, and (3) self-quarantine of infected individuals. Using a standard epidemiological model (SIR), we show here that by identification and isolation of the majority of infectious individuals, including those who may be asymptomatic, the reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 would be reduced well below 1.0, and the epidemic would collapse. We replicate these observations in a more complex stochastic dynamic model on a social network graph. We also find that the testing regime would be additive to other interventions, and be effective at any level of prevalence. If adopted as a policy, any industrial society could sustain the regime for as long as it takes to find a safe and effective cure or vaccine. Our model also indicates that unlike sampling-based tests, population-scale testing does not need to be very accurate: false negative rates up to 15% could be tolerated if 80% comply with testing every ten days, and false positives can be almost arbitrarily high when a high fraction of the population is already effectively quarantined. Testing at the required scale would be feasible if existing qPCR-based methods are scaled up and multiplexed. A mass produced, low throughput field test kit could also be carried out at home. Economic analysis also supports the feasibility of the approach: current reagent costs for tests are in the range of a dollar or less, and the estimated benefits for population-scale testing are so large that the policy would be cost-effective even if the costs were larger by more than two orders of magnitude. To identify both active and previous infections, both viral RNA and antibodies could be tested. All technologies to build such test kits, and to produce them in the scale required to test the entire world's population exist already. Integrating them, scaling up production, and implementing the testing regime will require resources and planning, but at a scale that is very small compared to the effort that every nation would devote to defending itself against a more traditional foe.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We consider recorded data published in Worldometers and COVID-19 India websites from April 2020 to July 2021, including periods of interest where these countries and states were hit severely by the pandemic. Our methodology is based on the classic susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model and can track the evolution of infections in communities, where we (a) allow for the susceptible and infected populations to be reset at times where surges, outbreaks or secondary waves appear in the recorded data sets, (b) consider the parameters in the SIR model that represent the effective transmission and recovery rates to be functions of time and (c) estimate the number of deaths by combining the model solutions with the recorded data sets to approximate them between consecutive surges, outbreaks or secondary waves, providing a more accurate estimate. We report on the status of the current infections in these countries and states, and the infections and deaths in India and Japan. Our model can adapt to the recorded data and can be used to explain them and importantly, to forecast the number of infected, recovered, removed and dead individuals, as well as it can estimate the effective infection and recovery rates as functions of time, assuming an outbreak occurs at a given time. The latter can be used to forecast the future reproduction number and together with the forecast on the number of infected and dead individuals, our approach can be used to suggest the implementation of intervention strategies and mitigation policies to keep at bay the number of infected and dead individuals.

The 2019-nCoV cases might have been under-reported roughly from 1 to 15 January 2020, and thus we estimated the number of unreported cases and the basic reproduction number, R(0), of 2019-nCoV. Methods: We modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases, in mainland China from 1 December 2019 to 24 January 2020 through the exponential growth. The number of unreported cases was determined by the maximum likelihood estimation. We used the serial intervals (SI) of infection caused by two other well-known coronaviruses (CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) CoVs, as approximations of the unknown SI for 2019-nCoV to estimate R(0). Results: We confirmed that the initial growth phase followed an exponential growth pattern.

METHODS: 20 older (age=65.6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b15.5 years) cognitively normal adults (65% female) who had previously undergone 2 nights in-lab sleep, memory and vigilance testing were delivered equipment for 2 nights at-home, technician-guided remote PSG set-up (1 night each for Somt\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 [EEG: Fp1-M2, Cz-M1] and Sleep Profiler (SP) [EEG: Fp1-Fp2] devices- randomized presentation), and 6 timed trials on a 3D spatial maze navigation memory plus morning psychomotor vigilance testing (PVT). The night-to-night differences for devices and in-lab versus at-home testing environments were compared for sleep macro and EEG microarchitecture using paired Wilcoxon rank sum and t-tests where appropriate. First-night maze completion time (CT) and PVT reaction time and lapses were also compared. RESULTS: 19 people completed 2 nights at-home PSG, 18 completed PVT and 9 completed all 6 maze trials. Quality frontal EEG signals were obtained for 16 SP and 11 Somt\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 recordings. There was no significant night to night differences (night 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153night 2) between in-lab and at-home environments for total sleep time (mean difference: in-lab= -0.27 vs at-home = 0.35 hours), wake after sleep onset (WASO) (median difference: in-lab= 3.0 vs at-home = 0.7 %WASO), or slow wave sleep (SWS) (mean difference: in-lab= -0.70 vs at-home = 2.3 %SWS). Relative frontal slow wave activity and spindle density were not significantly different between devices or environments. K-complex density (SP= 1.0 vs Somt\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 =2.7/minNREM2, p=0.004) was significantly reduced with the SP device compared to Somt\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 devices. There were no significant differences for maze CT and PVT measures between in-lab and at-home environments. CONCLUSION: The night-to-night differences in sleep macroarchitecture do not appear to be influenced by environment or device however measures of EEG microstructure such as K-complexes, which are amplitude-dependent, may be underestimated with the Sleep Profiler device due to smaller EEG amplitude from a derivation with short inter-electrode distances.

The reproduction number of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been found to vary over time, potentially being influenced by a multitude of factors such as varying control strategies, changes in public awareness and reaction or, as a recent study suggests, sensitivity to temperature or humidity changes. To take into consideration these constantly evolving factors, the paper introduces a time dynamic, humidity-dependent SEIR-type extended epidemiological model with range-defined parameters. Using primarily the historical data of the outbreak from Northern and Southern Italy and with the help of stochastic global optimization algorithms, we are able to determine a model parameter estimation that provides a high-quality fit to the data. The time-dependent contact rate showed a quick drop to a value slightly below 2. Applying the model for the COVID-19 outbreak in the northern region of Italy, we obtained parameters that suggest a slower shrinkage of the contact rate to a value slightly above 4. These findings indicate that model fitting and validation, even on a limited amount of available data, can provide useful insights and projections, uncover aspects that upon improvement might help mitigate the disease spreading.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods: We used outbreak data from clusters in Singapore and Tianjin, China to estimate the generation interval from symptom onset data while acknowledging uncertainty about the incubation period distribution and the underlying transmission network. From those estimates we obtained the proportions pre-symptomatic transmission and reproduction numbers. Results: The mean generation interval was 5.20 (95%CI 3.78-6.78) days for Singapore and 3.95 (95%CI 3.01-4.91) days for Tianjin, China when relying on a previously reported incubation period with mean 5.2 and SD 2.8 days.

Older adults may be particularly vulnerable. Coping strategies to manage stress can also impact health outcomes by modifying the relationships between perceived stress and health outcomes. This study examined concurrent and longitudinal associations between perceived stress and sleep health, mental health, physical health, and overall perceived health outcomes among older adults. We also examined whether coping strategies moderate these associations. METHODS: Older adults (n = 115; Mage = 68.62, 58.3% female) reported perceived stress (PSS), coping strategies (Brief COPE), global sleep quality (PSQI global sleep quality score and dichotomous good/poor sleep quality), depressive symptoms (CES-D), and perceived mental, physical, and overall health (RAND-12) before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. RESULTS: The number of individuals with poor sleep quality was greater during the COVID-19 pandemic than before (50% vs. 36.5%). Participants also reported poorer physical health during the COVID-19 pandemic than before. Hierarchical linear regression and hierarchical logistic regression revealed that higher perceived stress was cross-sectionally associated with poorer sleep (e.g., higher total PSQI score and dichotomous sleep quality category). Higher perceived stress was associated with worse depressive symptoms and global mental health concurrently and longitudinally. Coping strategies moderated the relationships between perceived stress and physical health and overall perceived health. For example, higher perceived stress was associated with poorer overall perceived health for those who have lower problem-focused coping\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dbut not for those with higher problem-focused coping\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dboth concurrently and longitudinally. CONCLUSION: Perceived stress influences cross-sectional and longitudinal measures of sleep health and general health among older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coping strategies can moderate the effects of perceived stress on health outcomes. Older adults may benefit from prevention and intervention strategies targeting stress management and problem-focused coping strategies.

SARS-CoV-2 virus has circulated in hospitals, care homes and the community since January 2020. Our current epidemiological knowledge is largely informed by clinical cases with far less understanding of community transmission. Methods The REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission (REACT) study is a nationally representative prevalence survey of SARS-CoV-2 virus swab-positivity in the community in England. We recruited participants regardless of symptom status. Results We found 159 positives from 120,610 swabs giving an average prevalence of 0.13% (95% CI: 0.11%,0.15%) from 1st May to 1st June 2020. We showed decreasing prevalence with a halving time of 8.6 (6.2, 13.6) days, implying an overall reproduction number R of 0.57 (0.45, 0.72). Adults aged 18 to 24 yrs had the highest swab-positivity rates, while those >64 yrs had the lowest. Of the 126 participants who tested positive with known symptom status in the week prior to their swab, 39 reported symptoms while 87 did not, giving an estimate that 69% (61%,76%) of people were symptom-free for the 7 days prior testing positive in our community sample. Symptoms strongly associated with swab-positivity were: nausea and/or vomiting, diarrhoea, blocked nose, loss of smell, loss of taste, headache, chills and severe fatigue. Recent contact with a known COVID-19 case was associated with odds of 24 (16, 38) for swab-positivity. Compared with non-key workers, odds of swab-positivity were 7.7 (2.4, 25) among care home (long-term care facilities) workers and 5.2 (2.9, 9.3) among health care workers. However, some of the excess risk associated with key worker status was explained by recent contact with COVID-19 cases. We found no strong evidence for geographical variability in positive swab results. Conclusion Our results provide a reliable baseline against which the impact of subsequent relaxation of lockdown can be assessed to inform future public health efforts to control transmission.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "COVID-19 severity determinants inferred through ecological and epidemiological modeling\nDeterminants of COVID-19 clinical severity are commonly assessed by transverse or longitudinal studies of the fatality counts. However, the fatality counts depend both on disease clinical severity and transmissibility, as more infected also lead to more deaths. Moreover, fatality counts (and related measures such as Case Fatality Rate) are dynamic quantities, as they appear with a delay to infections, while different geographic regions generally belong to different points on the epidemics curve. Instead, we use epidemiological modeling to propose a disease severity measure, which accounts for the underlying disease dynamics. The measure corresponds to the ratio of population averaged mortality and recovery rates (m/r). It is independent of the disease transmission dynamics (i.e., the basic reproduction number) and has a direct mechanistic interpretation. We use this measure to assess demographic, medical, meteorological and environmental factors associated with the disease severity. For this, we employ an ecological regression study design and analyze different US states during the first disease outbreak. Principal Component Analysis, followed by univariate and multivariate analyses based on machine learning techniques, is used for selecting important predictors. Without using prior knowledge from clinical studies, we recover significant predictors known to influence disease severity, in particular age, chronic diseases, and racial factors. Additionally, we identify long-term pollution exposure and population density as not widely recognized (though for the pollution previously hypothesized) predictors of the disease severity. Overall, the proposed measure is useful for inferring severity determinants of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and the obtained results may aid a better understanding of COVID-19 risks.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

It is referred to as a SEIRDEoIo since the dead individuals caused by the disease are defined as a new subpopulation. The potential contribution of the disease propagation of non-resident external infected travellers is considered as well as a re-susceptibility which increases the susceptible numbers and a parallel loss of immunity caused by a potential delayed re-infection. The model is also studied under eventual vaccination and treatment controls each one of them including two additive terms including proportional feedback of the susceptible and infectious, respectively, as well as control actions being independent of the population numbers. The disease-free and endemic equilibrium points are characterized, as well as their dependence on the control gains, and their stability properties are also studied. It is found that they are unique and only one of the two is a global attractor depending on the model parameter values. Typically, the value of the basic reproduction number is crucial to characterize the stability or, alternatively, that of the coefficient transmission rate provided that the remaining parameters are prefixed. The controls are also useful to increase the admissible minimum threshold of the infection force compatible with the stability of the disease-free equilibrium point.

                "prompt": "The global COVID-19 pandemic at a crossroads: relevant countermeasures and ways ahead\nBackground: Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan, China at the beginning of December 2019, there have been over 11,200,000 confirmed cases in the world as of the 3rd July 2020, affecting over 213 countries and regions with nearly 530,000 deaths. The pandemic has been sweeping all continents, North America, Latin America, Europe, Middle East and South Asia among others at an alarming rapidity. Here, we provide an estimate of the scale of the pandemic spread under different scenarios of variation in key influencing parameters with a hybrid model. Methods: We developed a new hybrid model of infectious disease transmission based on Cellular Automata (CA)-configured SEIR to analyse the COVID-19 outbreak and estimate its transmission pattern. A probabilistic contamination network is embedded in the pandemic transmission model to capture the randomness feature of person-to-person spread of the novel virus. We used the improved SEIR model to quantify the population contact state with isolation measures under different continuous time series contact probability via CA. We adjusted the modelling parameters to verify the model performance in accordance to the data from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. We simulated several scenarios by varying such key parameters as number of isolation rate, average contact times of the population, number of infected people before taking prevention and control measures, medical level and number of imported cases. Results: In the baseline model, we identified that the isolation control as the most influencing factor that had the largest impact on decreasing the speed of the reproductive number, accelerating the arrival of the \"inflection point\" of pandemic prevention and control, and the death rate reduction. We estimated that the probability of people contacts and the number of the onset infected cases before prevention measures also had significant effect on the infection rate reduction with appropriate prevention measures adoption, which partly reflects the impact of timely measure on the severity of the outbreak. We found that imported cases will risk the domestic prevention. Conclusions: Our modelling results clearly indicate that early-stage preventive measures are the most effective way to contain the pandemic spread and a strong interventionist approach needs to be adopted by policymakers vis-\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a0-vis of the highly contagious nature of the COVID-19. Human resources, intensified isolation and confinement as well as special hospital buildings should be prioritised in countries with large number of infections to constrain the global transmission of the virulent infection.

Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits, including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms, and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest approach predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with mean accuracy of 89.4% compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection was the strongest predictor of severe disease. Further notable predictors of severe disease included having neural and/or renal tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R(0) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a4 1) human-to-human transmissibility. We present a novel, to our knowledge, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

DESIGN: Retrospective epidemiological analysis. SETTING: Multiple healthcare facilities of secondary and tertiary care centres in an urban setting. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 185 laboratory-confirmed cases with partially known dates of illness onset and most likely sources of infection. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Superspreaders were identified using the transmission tree. The reproduction number, that is, the average number of secondary cases produced by a single primary case, was estimated as a function of time and according to different types of hosts. RESULTS: A total of five superspreaders were identified. The reproduction number throughout the course of the outbreak was estimated at 1.0 due to reconstruction of the transmission tree, while the variance of secondary cases generated by a primary case was 52.1. All of the superspreaders involved in this outbreak appeared to have generated a substantial number of contacts in multiple healthcare facilities (association: p<0.01), generating on average 4.0 (0.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01538.6) and 28.6 (0.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015363.9) secondary cases among patients who visited multiple healthcare facilities and others. The time-dependent reproduction numbers declined substantially below the value of 1 on and after 13 June 2015.

Here, we provide forecasts for the potential incidence rate, and magnitude, of a COVID-19 epidemic in Kenya based on the observed growth rate and age distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases observed in China, whilst accounting for the demographic and geographic dissimilarities between China and Kenya. Methods We developed a modelling framework to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Kenya, KenyaCoV. KenyaCoV was used to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission both within, and between, different Kenyan regions and age groups. KenyaCoV was parameterized using a combination of human mobility data between the defined regions, the recent 2019 Kenyan census, and estimates of age group social interaction rates specific to Kenya. Key epidemiological characteristics such as the basic reproductive number and the age-specific rate of developing COVID-19 symptoms after infection with SARS-CoV-2, were adapted for the Kenyan setting from a combination of published estimates and analysis of the age distribution of cases observed in the Chinese outbreak. Results We find that if person-to-person transmission becomes established within Kenya, identifying the role of subclinical, and therefore largely undetected, infected individuals is critical to predicting and containing a very significant epidemic. Depending on the transmission scenario our reproductive number estimates for Kenya range from 1.78 (95% CI 1.44 - 2.14) to 3.46 (95% CI 2.81-4.17). In scenarios where asymptomatic infected individuals are transmitting significantly, we expect a rapidly growing epidemic which cannot be contained only by case isolation. In these scenarios, there is potential for a very high percentage of the population becoming infected (median estimates: >80% over six months), and a significant epidemic of symptomatic COVID-19 cases. Exceptional social distancing measures can slow transmission, flattening the epidemic curve, but the risk of epidemic rebound after lifting restrictions is predicted to be high.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods: this is an ecological study with data from confirmed cases of COVID-19 reported between March 21, 2020 and May 3, 2020 in Ponta Grossa and proportion of severity, hospitalization and lethality in the literature. A susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic model was developed, and reproduction rate (R0), duration of epidemic, peak period, number of cases, hospitalized patients and deaths were estimated. Deaths were calculated by age group and in three scenarios: at day 24, at day 34, and at day 44 of the epidemic. Results: in the three scenarios assessed in this study, the variation in the number of cases was explained by an exponential curve (r2=0.74, 0.79 and 0.89, respectively, p&lt;0.0001 in all scenarios). The SIR model estimated that, in the best scenario, the peak period will be around 120 days after the first case (between July 11, 2020 and July 25, 2020), estimated R0 will be 1.07 and will infect 0.23% of the population. In the worst scenario, peak period will involve 4,375 (95% CI; 4156-4594) cases and 825 (95% CI; 700-950) cases in the best scenario. Most cases and hospital admissions will involve patients aged 20 to 39 years, the number of deaths will be higher among the elderly and more pronounced among patients aged &#8805;80 years. Conclusion: this is the first study that provides COVID-19 projections for a municipality that is not a large capital. It shows a peak period at a later moment; therefore, the municipality will have more time to prepare and adopt protective measures to reduce the number of simultaneous cases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

New pathogens are believed to emerge from animal reservoirs when ecological changes increase the pathogen's opportunities to enter the human population(1) and to generate subsequent human-to-human transmission(2). Effective human-to-human transmission requires that the pathogen's basic reproductive number, R(0), should exceed one, where R(0) is the average number of secondary infections arising from one infected individual in a completely susceptible population(3). However, an increase in R(0), even when insufficient to generate an epidemic, nonetheless increases the number of subsequently infected individuals. Here we show that, as a consequence of this, the probability of pathogen evolution to R(0) > 1 and subsequent disease emergence can increase markedly.

To avoid a larger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of strong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine is the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to estimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into seven categories for simulation. Based on a Least-Squares procedure and officially published data, the estimation of parameters for the proposed model is given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the transmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend of the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role in controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The control reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and discussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is in decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human transmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may become a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease is still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the virus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index is introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high and low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail vaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the effectiveness of efficient vaccination.

But India as a country is in the second position in a high number of confirmed cases (33,678,786) in the world (after the United States of America) and third position in the number of COVID-19 deaths (after the United States and Brazil) at 465,082 deaths. Almost above numbers are dominantly seen in the second wave only. Thus, future long-term projections are required to mitigate the impact. METHODS: The conventional SIR model was modified so that a new compartment Q(quarantine) is added to the conventional SIR model to analyze the COVID-19 impact. The parameter optimal control technique was used to fit the curve by estimating the infection, susceptible, etc. RESULTS: The model predicts the cumulative number of cases of 2.6928E7 with a confidence interval of 95%, CI[2.6921E7,2.6935E7], and an accuracy of 99.3% on May 25, 2020(480th day from 30 to 01\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532020).

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Kaiser Permanente integrated healthcare delivery systems serving populations in northern California, southern California, and Washington state. PARTICIPANTS: 1840 people with a first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19 by 22 April 2020, among 9 596 321 healthcare plan enrollees. Analyses of hospital length of stay and clinical outcomes included 1328 people admitted by 9 April 2020 (534 in northern California, 711 in southern California, and 83 in Washington). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cumulative incidence of first acute hospital admission for confirmed covid-19, and subsequent probabilities of admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) and mortality, as well as duration of hospital stay and ICU stay. The effective reproduction number (R(E)) describing transmission dynamics was estimated for each region. RESULTS: As of 22 April 2020, cumulative incidences of a first acute hospital admission for covid-19 were 15.6 per 100 000 cohort members in northern California, 23.3 per 100 000 in southern California, and 14.7 per 100 000 in Washington. Accounting for censoring of incomplete hospital stays among those admitted by 9 April 2020, the estimated median duration of stay among survivors was 9.3 days (with 95% staying 0.8 to 32.9 days) and among non-survivors was 12.7 days (1.6 to 37.7 days). The censoring adjusted probability of ICU admission for male patients was 48.5% (95% confidence interval 41.8% to 56.3%) and for female patients was 32.0% (26.6% to 38.4%). For patients requiring critical care, the median duration of ICU stay was 10.6 days (with 95% staying 1.3 to 30.8 days). The censoring adjusted case fatality ratio was 23.5% (95% confidence interval 19.6% to 28.2%) among male inpatients and 14.9% (11.8% to 18.6%) among female inpatients; mortality risk increased with age for both male and female patients. Reductions in R(E) were identified over the study period within each region. CONCLUSIONS: Among residents of California and Washington state enrolled in Kaiser Permanente healthcare plans who were admitted to hospital with covid-19, the probabilities of ICU admission, of long hospital stay, and of mortality were identified to be high.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the countries suffering the most with the COVID-19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemic trend of the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time-series data of COVID-19 from Jan 22 2020 to Apr 02 2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with a similar total population number to Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the mean of basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was 4.34 (95% CI, 3.04\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01536.00) in Italy and 3.16 (95% CI, 1.73\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01535.25) in Hunan.

We propose using a simulation-based, Bayesian method known as Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to fit and assess phylodynamic models that simulate pathogen evolution and ecology against summaries of these data. We illustrate the versatility of the method by analyzing two spatial models describing the phylodynamics of interpandemic human influenza virus subtype A(H3N2). The first model captures antigenic drift phenomenologically with continuously waning immunity, and the second epochal evolution model describes the replacement of major, relatively long-lived antigenic clusters. Combining features of long-term surveillance data from the Netherlands with features of influenza A (H3N2) hemagglutinin gene sequences sampled in northern Europe, key phylodynamic parameters can be estimated with ABC. Goodness-of-fit analyses reveal that the irregularity in interannual incidence and H3N2's ladder-like hemagglutinin phylogeny are quantitatively only reproduced under the epochal evolution model within a spatial context. However, the concomitant incidence dynamics result in a very large reproductive number and are not consistent with empirical estimates of H3N2's population level attack rate. These results demonstrate that the interactions between the evolutionary and ecological processes impose multiple quantitative constraints on the phylodynamic trajectories of influenza A(H3N2), so that sequence and surveillance data can be used synergistically. ABC, one of several data synthesis approaches, can easily interface a broad class of phylodynamic models with various types of data but requires careful calibration of the summaries and tolerance parameters.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

One hundred and ten pigs were distributed in ten isolated rooms as follows: (i) non-vaccinated (NV), (ii) vaccinated with a heterologous vaccine (HE), and (iii) vaccinated with a homologous inactivated vaccine (HO). The study was run with multiple replicates and for each replicate, an infected non-vaccinated pig was placed with 10 contact pigs for two weeks and transmission of influenza evaluated daily by analyzing individual nasal swabs by RT-PCR. A statistically significant difference between R estimates was observed between vaccinated and non-vaccinated pigs (p < 0.05). A statistically significant reduction in transmission was observed in the vaccinated groups where R (95%CI) was 1 (0.39-2.09) and 0 for the HE and the HO groups respectively, compared to an R(o )value of 10.66 (6.57-16.46) in NV pigs (p < 0.05).

We assessed how the type and timing of public- health interventions impacted the course of the outbreak in Alberta and other Canadian provinces. Methods: We used publicly-available data to summarize rates of laboratory data and mortality in relation to measures implemented to contain the outbreak and testing strategy. We estimated the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 before the state of emergency declaration for each province (R0) and at the study end date (Rt). Results: The first cases were confirmed in Ontario (January 25) and British Columbia (January 28). All provinces implemented the same health-policy measures between March 12 and March 30. Alberta had a higher percentage of the population tested (3.8%) and a lower mortality rate (3/100,000) than Ontario (2.6%; 11/100,000) or Quebec (3.1%; 31/100,000). British Columbia tested fewer people (1.7%) and had similar mortality as Alberta. Data on provincial testing strategies were insufficient to inform further analyses.

The outbreak is currently under control in Alberta, British Columbia and Nova Scotia (Rt <1). Interpretation: COVID-19-related health outcomes varied by province despite rapid implementation of similar health-policy interventions across Canada. Insufficient information about provincial testing strategies and a lack of primary data on serial interval are major limitations of existing data on the Canadian COVID-19 outbreak.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The resulting data provide a rare opportunity to measure key metrics of disease course, transmission, and the impact of control measures. METHODS: From Jan 14 to Feb 12, 2020, the Shenzhen Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified 391 SARS-CoV-2 cases and 1286 close contacts. We compared cases identified through symptomatic surveillance and contact tracing, and estimated the time from symptom onset to confirmation, isolation, and admission to hospital. We estimated metrics of disease transmission and analysed factors influencing transmission risk. FINDINGS: Cases were older than the general population (mean age 45 years) and balanced between males (n=187) and females (n=204). 356 (91%) of 391 cases had mild or moderate clinical severity at initial assessment. As of Feb 22, 2020, three cases had died and 225 had recovered (median time to recovery 21 days; 95% CI 20-22). Cases were isolated on average 4\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b76 days (95% CI 4\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71-5\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70) after developing symptoms; contact tracing reduced this by 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b79 days (95% CI 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71-2\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b77). Household contacts and those travelling with a case were at higher risk of infection (odds ratio 6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b727 [95% CI 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b749-26\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b733] for household contacts and 7\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b706 [1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b743-34\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b791] for those travelling with a case) than other close contacts. The household secondary attack rate was 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b72% (95% CI 9\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71-13\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b78), and children were as likely to be infected as adults (infection rate 7\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b74% in children <10 years vs population average of 6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b76%). The observed reproductive number (R) was 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b74 (95% CI 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b73-0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b75), with a mean serial interval of 6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b73 days (95% CI 5\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b72-7\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b76). INTERPRETATION: Our data on cases as well as their infected and uninfected close contacts provide key insights into the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2. This analysis shows that isolation and contact tracing reduce the time during which cases are infectious in the community, thereby reducing the R. The overall impact of isolation and contact tracing, however, is uncertain and highly dependent on the number of asymptomatic cases. Moreover, children are at a similar risk of infection to the general population, although less likely to have severe symptoms; hence they should be considered in analyses of transmission and control.

Mandates to wear face masks in indoor public areas are often met with confusion, fear, anger, disagreement, and lack of knowledge about risks and benefits of action and inaction. To move towards an evidence-based approach, we propose that when five criteria collectively signal that a communicable disease poses greater harm to society than that of a benchmark, such as that of the average seasonal influenza during years 2010 to 2019, then the local, state, and federal government should introduce an indoor mask-wearing mandate, subject to certain exceptions. We suggest the following five measures and corresponding metrics comprising composite criteria for the requirement to wear a mask: contagiousness (R0), vulnerability of communities to infection (rate of growth in the percentage of the national population that is infected), harm caused by the disease (cumulative deaths per week), severity of harm (infection fatality rate), and direction of harm (percentage change in cumulative deaths per week). Each criterion would be scored. An aggregate score would then signal when the social health risk exceeds that of seasonal influenza as a point of reference, based on methodology. Although additional details would require clarification, attention to validity and timeliness of measurement, and development of appropriate scoring thresholds, the criteria provide a foundation for action that goes beyond rhetoric, politics, impulsiveness, and guesswork. Pursuing measurement of these factors would yield an improvement over the current approach.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Here we compared the epidemiological characteristics of laboratory-confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19 in Wuhan. METHODS: Demographics, case severity and outcomes of 29,886 confirmed cases and 21,960 clinically diagnosed cases reported between December 2019 and February 24, 2020, were compared. The risk factors were estimated, and the effective reproduction number (Rt) of SARS-CoV-2 was also calculated. RESULTS: The age and occupation distribution of confirmed cases and clinically diagnosed cases were consistent, and their sex ratio were 1.0 and 0.9, respectively. The epidemic curve of clinical diagnosis cases was similar to that of confirmed cases, and the city centers had more cumulative cases and higher incidence density than suburbs in both of two groups. The proportion of severe and critical cases (21.5 % vs. 14.0 %, P < 0.0001) and case fatality rates (5.2 % vs. 1.2 %, P < 0.0001) of confirmed cases were all higher than those of clinically diagnosed cases. Risk factors for death we observed in both of two groups were older age, male, severe or critical cases. Rt showed the same trend in two groups, it dropped below 1.0 on February 6 among confirmed cases, and February 8 among clinically diagnosed cases. CONCLUSIONS: The demographic characteristics and spatiotemporal distributions of confirmed and clinically diagnosed cases are roughly similar, but the disease severity and clinical outcome of clinically diagnosed cases are better than those of confirmed cases. In cases when detection kits are insufficient during the early epidemic, the implementation of clinical diagnosis is necessary and effective.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The basic reproductive rate (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 is estimated to be 2\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b75 (range 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b78-3\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b76) compared with 2\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70-3\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70 for SARS-CoV and the 1918 influenza pandemic, 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b79 for MERS-CoV, and 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b75 for the 2009 influenza pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 causes mild or asymptomatic disease in most cases; however, severe to critical illness occurs in a small proportion of infected individuals, with the highest rate seen in people older than 70 years. The measured case fatality rate varies between countries, probably because of differences in testing strategies.

We trained the model to predict future incident cases, deaths and the reproductive number, R. For most counties, it makes accurate predictions of new incident cases, deaths and R values, up to 30 days in the future. Our framework can also be used to predict other targets that are useful indices for policymaking, for example hospitalization or the occupancy of intensive care units. Our DL framework is publicly available on GitHub and can be adapted for other indices of the COVID-19 spread.

While vaccines are being globally deployed, variants of concern (VOCs) are emerging with the potential for vaccine escape. VOCs are characterized by a higher within-host transmissibility, and this may alter their susceptibility to antiviral treatment. Here we describe a model to understand the effect of changes in within-host reproduction number R(0), as proxy for transmissibility, of VOCs on the effectiveness of antiviral therapy with molnupiravir through modeling and simulation. Molnupiravir (EIDD-2801 or MK 4482) is an orally bioavailable antiviral drug inhibiting viral replication through lethal mutagenesis, ultimately leading to viral extinction. We simulated 800 mg molnupiravir treatment every 12 h for 5 days, with treatment initiated at different time points before and after infection. Modeled viral mutations range from 1.25 to 2-fold greater transmissibility than wild type, but also include putative co-adapted variants with lower transmissibility (0.75-fold). Antiviral efficacy was correlated with R(0), making highly transmissible VOCs more sensitive to antiviral therapy. Total viral load was reduced by up to 70% in highly transmissible variants compared to 30% in wild type if treatment was started in the first 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533 days post inoculation. Less transmissible variants appear less susceptible.

Furthermore, clinical trials with borderline efficacious results should consider identifying VOCs and examine their impact in post-hoc analysis.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Firstly, some qualitative properties of the model are analyzed. The basic reproduction number $R_{0}$ is derived. When $R_{0}<1$, the disease-free equilibrium point is unique and locally asymptotically stable. When $R_{0}>1$, the endemic equilibrium point is also unique. Furthermore, some conditions are established to ensure the local asymptotic stability of disease-free and endemic equilibrium points. The trend of COVID-19 spread in the United States is predicted. Considering the influence of the individual behavior and government mitigation measurement, a modified SEIQRP model is proposed, defined as SEIQRPD model. According to the real data of the United States, it is found that our improved model has a better prediction ability for the epidemic trend in the next two weeks.

Our approach is similar to non-parametric curve fitting in spirit and automatically adapts to key external factors, such as interventions, while retaining the parsimonious nature of the standard SIR(D) model. Initial dynamic temporal estimates of the model parameters are obtained by minimising the aggregate residual sum of squares across the number of infections, recoveries, and fatalities, over a chosen lag period. Then a geometric smoother is applied to obtain the final time series of estimates. These estimates are used to obtain dynamic temporal robust estimates of the key feature of this pandemic, namely the \"reproduction number\". We illustrate our method on the Indian COVID-19 data for the period March 14 - August 31, 2020. The time series data plots of the 36 states and union territories shows a clear presence of inter-regional variation in the prognosis of the epidemic. This is also bourne out by the estimates of the underlying parameters, including the reproduction numbers for the 36 regions. Due to this, an SIR(D) model, dynamic or otherwise, on the national aggregate data is not suited for robust local predictions. The time series of estimates of the model enables us to carry out daily, weekly and also long term predictions, including construction of predictive bands. We obtain an excellent agreement between the actual data and the model predicted data at the regional level. Our estimates of the current reproduction number turn out to be more than 2 in three regions (Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh) and between 1.5 and 2 in 13 regions. Each of these regions have experienced an individual trajectory, which typically involves initial phase of shock(s) followed by a relatively steady lower level of the reproduction number.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

To gain a deeper understanding about the future dynamics of COVID-19, a compartmental mathematical model has been proposed in this paper incorporating all possible non-pharmaceutical intervention policies. Model parameters have been calibrated using sophisticated trust-region-reflective algorithm and short-term projection results have been illustrated for Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, Colombia and India. Control reproduction numbers (Rc) have been calculated in order to get insights about the current epidemic scenario in the above-mentioned countries. Forecasting results depict that the aforesaid countries are having downward trends in daily COVID-19 cases. However, it is highly recommended to use efficacious face coverings and maintain strict physical distancing, as the pandemic is not over in any country. Global sensitivity analysis enlightens the fact that efficacy of face coverings is the most significant parameter, which could significantly control the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus compared to other non-pharmaceutical measures. In addition, reduction in effective contact rate with isolated patients is also essential in bringing down the epidemic threshold (Rc) below unity. All necessary graphical simulations have been performed with the help of Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivatives. In addition, optimal control problem for fractional system has been designed and the existence of unique solution has also been showed by using Picard-Lindelof technique. Finally, the unconditionally stability of the given fractional numerical technique has been proved.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Estimates of the impact of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission are critical for decision making in this and future outbreaks. We here aim to assess the impact of these NPIs on disease transmission by estimating changes in the basic reproduction number (R0) at national and cantonal levels in relation to the timing of these NPIs. We estimated the time-varying R0 nationally and in eleven cantons by fitting a stochastic transmission model explicitly simulating within-hospital dynamics. We used individual-level data from more than 1000 hospitalised patients in Switzerland and public daily reports of hospitalisations and deaths. We estimated the national R0 to be 2.8 (95% confidence interval 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8) at the beginning of the epidemic. Starting from around 7 March, we found a strong reduction in time-varying R0 with a 86% median decrease (95% quantile range [QR] 79\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015390%) to a value of 0.40 (95% QR 0.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01530.58) in the period of 29 March to 5 April. At the cantonal level, R0 decreased over the course of the epidemic between 53% and 92%. Reductions in time-varying R0 were synchronous with changes in mobility patterns as estimated through smartphone activity, which started before the official implementation of NPIs. We inferred that most of the reduction of transmission is attributable to behavioural changes as opposed to natural immunity, the latter accounting for only about 4% of the total reduction in effective transmission. As Switzerland considers relaxing some of the restrictions of social mixing, current estimates of time-varying R0 well below one are promising. However, as of 24 April 2020, at least 96% (95% QR 95.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.4%) of the Swiss population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.

It has not affected all regions similarly, since the death rate can vary several folds between regions where the epidemic has remained at a low level and regions where it got an early burst. The epidemic has been slowed down by a lockdown that lasted for almost eight weeks, and individuals can now move between metropolitan French regions without restriction. In this report we investigate the effect on the epidemic of summer holidays, during which millions of individuals will move between French regions. Additionally, we evaluate the effect of strong or weak seasonality and of several values for the reproduction number on the epidemic, in particular on the timing, the height and the spread of a second wave. To do so, we extend a SEIR model to simulate the effect of summer migrations between regions on the number and distribution of new infections. We find that the model predicts little effect of summer migrations on the epidemic. However, all the reproduction numbers above 1.0 and the seasonality parameters we tried result in a second epidemic wave, with a peak date that can vary between October 2020 and April 2021. If the sanitary measures currently in place manage to keep the reproduction number below 1.0, the second wave will be avoided. If they keep the reproduction number at a low value, for instance at 1.1 as in one of our simulations, the second wave is flattened and could be similar to the first wave.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Studies addressing parameters that may influence COVID-19 progression relied on either the total numbers of detected cases and similar proxies and/or a small number of analyzed factors, including analysis of regions that display a narrow range of these parameters. We here apply a novel approach, exploiting widespread growth regimes in COVID-19 detected case counts. By applying nonlinear dynamics methods to the exponential regime, we extract basic reproductive number R0 (i.e., the measure of COVID-19 inherent biological transmissibility), applying to the completely naive population in the absence of social distancing, for 118 different countries. We then use bioinformatics methods to systematically collect data on a large number of demographics and weather parameters from these countries, and seek their correlations with the rate of COVID-19 spread. In addition to some of the already reported tendencies, we show a number of both novel results and those that help settle existing disputes: the absence of dependence on wind speed and air pressure, negative correlation with precipitation; significant positive correlation with society development level (human development index) irrespective of testing policies, and percent of the urban population, but an absence of correlation with population density per se. We find a strong positive correlation of transmissibility on alcohol consumption, and the absence of correlation on refugee numbers, contrary to some widespread beliefs.

Notably, the differences between cluster-level and population-level outbreaks in epidemiological characteristics and transmissibility remain unclear. Identifying the characteristics of these two levels, including epidemiology and transmission dynamics, allows us to develop better surveillance and control strategies following the current removal of suppression measures in China. METHODS: We described the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and calculated its transmissibility by taking a Chinese city as an example. We used descriptive analysis to characterize epidemiological features for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence database from 1 Jan 2020 to 2 March 2020 in Chaoyang District, Beijing City, China. The susceptible-exposed-infected-asymptomatic-recovered (SEIAR) model was fitted with the dataset, and the effective reproduction number (R(eff)) was calculated as the transmissibility of a single population. Also, the basic reproduction number (R(0)) was calculated by definition for three clusters, such as household, factory and community, as the transmissibility of subgroups. RESULTS: The epidemic curve in Chaoyang District was divided into three stages. We included nine clusters (subgroups), which comprised of seven household-level and one factory-level and one community-level cluster, with sizes ranging from 2 to 17 cases. For the nine clusters, the median incubation period was 17.0 days [Interquartile range (IQR): 8.4\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0 days (d)], and the average interval between date of onset (report date) and diagnosis date was 1.9 d (IQR: 1.7 to 6.4 d). At the population level, the transmissibility of the virus was high in the early stage of the epidemic (R(eff) = 4.81). The transmissibility was higher in factory-level clusters (R(0) = 16) than in community-level clusters (R(0) = 3), and household-level clusters (R(0) = 1). CONCLUSIONS: In Chaoyang District, the epidemiological features of SARS-CoV-2 showed multi-stage pattern. Many clusters were reported to occur indoors, mostly from households and factories, and few from the community. The risk of transmission varies by setting, with indoor settings being more severe than outdoor settings. Reported household clusters were the predominant type, but the population size of the different types of clusters limited transmission. The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 was different between a single population and its subgroups, with cluster-level transmissibility higher than population-level transmissibility.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Compartmental models are a useful framework for investigating transmission of diseases in societies. To understand how the infection will spread and how to limit the outbreak.

This work proposes to revalue waste from the Colombian fique agroindustry. For this purpose, cellulose nanofibers were obtained from fique and used as reinforcement material to create acrylic superabsorbent hydrogels. Unreinforced acrylic hydrogels (AHR0) and acrylic hydrogels reinforced with fique nanofibers at 3% w/w (AHR3), 5% w/w (AHR5), and 10 % w/w (AHR10) were synthesized using the solution polymerization method. The best hydrogel formulation for agricultural purposes was chosen by comparing their swelling behavior, mechanical properties, and using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). By raising the nanofiber concentration to 3% (AHR3), the best-chosen formulation, the interaction between the nanofibers and the polymer matrix increased, which favored the network stability. However, beyond AHR3, there was a higher viscosity of the reactive system, which caused a reduction in the mobility of the polymer chains, thus disfavoring the swelling capacity.

First, we formulate and solve an inverse problem focusing mainly on the identification of the values $A_{0}$ and $ I_{0}$ of the undetected asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, at a time $t_{0}$, by available measurements of the isolated and recovered individuals at two succeeding times, $ t_{0}$ and $ T>t_{0}.$ Simultaneously, we identify the rate standing for the average number of individuals infected in unit time by an infective symptomatic individual.

Methods A multivariate model for the log10 of viral reproductive rate was constructed for each country using lockdown stringency (Oxford University tracker), temperature and humidity, for the 1st 110 days of 2020. This was validated by extrapolating to the following 51 days, and comparing the predicted viral rate and cumulative mortality with WHO data. The country models was extrapolated to July 2021 using projected weather forecast for four scenarios; continuing with the 11/6/2020 lockdown policy, 100% lockdown, 20% lockdown and no lockdown. Results From pooled data (40 countries), lockdown stringency had a strong negative correlation with log10viral reproductive rate (-0.648 at 21 days later). Maximum temperature correlated at -0.14, 14 days later and humidity correlated at +0.25, 22 days later. Predictive Models were generated for 11 countries using multivariate regression of these parameters. The R2 correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.817 to 0.987 for the model generation period. For the validation period, the Pearson's coefficient of correlation for log10R0 ranged from 0.344 to 0.984 and for cumulative mortality from 0.980 to 1.000. Forward extrapolation of these models for 5 nations, demonstrate, that removing the lockdown will result in rapid spread of the disease ranging from as soon as July 2020 for Russia, UK, Italy and India to January 2021 for the USA. The current (11/6/20) lockdown in the USA, Spain, UK, France, Germany, Turkey can control the disease but other nations will need to intensify their lockdowns to prevent future resurgence. Most nations will require more stringent lockdowns in January than in July. Conclusion The viral reproductive rate is highly predicted by a combination of lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity.

Italy was the European epicenter for virus spread and one with most cases and deaths. The first Italian patient was diagnosed on February 18th, a young man hospitalized in Lombardy (Northern Italy). The Italian government not only isolated the village where he lived, but a few days later put the entire country in lockdown. We have here analyzed the COVID-19 Italian data during the first three months after the outbreak and the effect of lockdown. COVID-19 virus has a high transmission rate and is associated with high fatality rate especially in the older population. The initial reproduction rate of the virus (R0) in Italy was between 2.1 and 3.3 in different Italian regions, with a doubling time between 2.7 and 3.2 days. The number of confirmed cases has now reached 229,000 but after the lockdown R0 is finally below 1. Despite the lockdown, the number of infected and deceased patients in Italy was very high, with a lethality rate higher than in other countries. It is likely that number of cases is underestimating the real since the number of asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic is relatively high. It is important to investigate which patients are more vulnerable and also if other co-factors can account for this high fatality rate, since this pandemia is far from being resolved.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infection periods and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 19, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.38 at day 22 and 0.64 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic. We plan to perform again these calculations and publish a short note when the epidemic is over and the complete and precise data is available. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: We utilize a system biology model of COVID-19 to analyze the effect of altering baseline patient characteristics on the outcome of immunomodulatory therapies. We create example parameter sets meant to mimic diverse patient types. For each patient type, we define the optimal treatment, identify biologic programs responsible for clinical responses, and predict biomarkers of those programs. FINDINGS: Model states representing older and hyperinflamed patients respond better to immunomodulation than those representing obese and diabetic patients. The disparate clinical responses are driven by distinct biologic programs. Optimal treatment initiation time is determined by neutrophil recruitment, systemic cytokine expression, systemic microthrombosis and the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in older patients, and by RAS, systemic microthrombosis and trans IL6 signalling for hyperinflamed patients. For older and hyperinflamed patients, IL6 modulating therapy is predicted to be optimal when initiated very early (<4(th) day of infection) and broad immunosuppression therapy (corticosteroids) is predicted to be optimally initiated later in the disease (7(th) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 9(th) day of infection). We show that markers of biologic programs identified by the model correspond to clinically identified markers of disease severity. INTERPRETATION: We demonstrate that modelling of COVID-19 pathobiology can suggest biomarkers that predict optimal response to a given immunomodulatory treatment. Mathematical modelling thus constitutes a novel adjunct to predictive enrichment and may aid in the reduction of heterogeneity in critical care trials.

Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, three-arm (1:1:1) placebo-equivalent controlled trial conducted remotely throughout the United States, adult outpatients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection were recruited. Participants were randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) (400 mg BID x1day, followed by 200 mg BID x9days) with or without azithromycin (AZ) (500 mg, then 250 mg daily x4days) or placebo-equivalent (ascorbic acid (HCQ) and folic acid (AZ)), stratified by risk for progression to severe COVID-19 (high-risk vs. low-risk). Self-collected nasal swabs for SARS-CoV-2 PCR, FLUPro symptom surveys, EKGs and vital signs were collected daily. Primary endpoints were: (a) 14-day progression to lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI), 28-day COVID-19 related hospitalization, or death; (b) 14-day time to viral clearance; secondary endpoints included time to symptom resolution (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04354428). Due to the low rate of clinical outcomes, the study was terminated for operational futility. Findings: Between 15th April and 27th July 2020, 231 participants were enrolled and 219 initiated medication a median of 5.9 days after symptom onset. Among 129 high-risk participants, incident LRTI occurred in six (4.7%) participants (two control, four HCQ/AZ) and COVID-19 related hospitalization in seven (5.4%) (four control, one HCQ, two HCQ/AZ); no LRTI and two (2%) hospitalizations occurred in the 102 low-risk participants (one HCQ, one HCQ/AZ). There were no deaths. Among 152 participants with viral shedding at enrollment, median time to clearance was 5 days (95% CI=4-6) in HCQ, 6 days (95% CI=4-8) in HCQ/AZ, and 8 days (95% CI=6-10) in control. Viral clearance was faster in HCQ (HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.01-2.60, p = 0.047) but not HCQ/AZ (HR=1.25, p = 0.39) compared to control. Among 197 participants who met the COVID-19 definition at enrollment, time to symptom resolution did not differ by group (HCQ: HR=1.02, 95% CI-0.63-1.64, p = 0.95, HCQ/AZ: HR=0.91, 95% CI=0.57-1.45, p = 0.70). Interpretation: Neither HCQ nor HCQ/AZ shortened the clinical course of outpatients with COVID-19, and HCQ, but not HCQ/AZ, had only a modest effect on SARS-CoV-2 viral shedding. HCQ and HCQ/AZ are not effective therapies for outpatient treatment of SARV-CoV-2 infection.

When the disease progression is long such as for HIV, individuals often experience switches among different states. We derive an epidemic model in which infected individuals have a discrete set of states of infectivity and can switch among different states. The model also incorporates a general incidence form in which new infections are distributed among different disease states. We discuss the importance of the transmission-transfer network for infectious diseases. Under the assumption that the tranmission-transfer network is strongly connected, we establish that the basic reproduction number R 0 is a sharp threshold parameter: if R 0 &#8804; 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable and the disease always dies out; if R 0 > 1 , the disease-free equilibrium is unstable, the system is uniformly persistent and initial outbreaks lead to persistent disease infection. For a restricted class of incidence functions, we prove that there is a unique endemic equilibrium and it is globally asymptotically stable when R 0 > 1 . Furthermore, we discuss the impact of different state structures on R 0 , on the distribution of the disease states at the unique endemic equilibrium, and on disease control and preventions.

The study developed a new SIR framework that allows the transmission rate of infectious diseases to decline along with the reduced risk of contact infection to overcome the limitations of the conventional SIR model. Two new SIR models were formulated to mimic the declining transmission rate of infectious diseases at different stages of transmission. Model A utilized the declining transmission rate along with the reduced risk of contact infection following infection, while Model B incorporated the declining transmission rate following recovery. Both new models and the conventional SIR model were then used to simulate an infectious disease with a basic reproduction number (r(0)) of 3.0 and a herd immunity threshold (HIT) of 0.667 with and without vaccination. Outcomes of simulations were assessed at the time when the total immunized population reached the level predicted by the HIT, and at the end of simulations. Further, all three models were used to simulate the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza in the United States and disease burdens were projected and compared with estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For the simulated infectious disease, in the initial phase of the outbreak, all three models performed expectedly when the sizes of infectious and recovered populations were relatively small. As the infectious population increased, the conventional SIR model appeared to overestimate the infections even when the HIT was achieved in all scenarios with and without vaccination. For the same scenario, Model A appeared to attain the level predicted by the HIT and in comparison, Model B projected the infectious disease to be controlled at the level predicted by the HIT only at high vaccination rates. For infectious diseases with high r(0), and at low vaccination rates, the level at which the infectious disease was controlled cannot be accurately predicted by the current theorem. Transmission dynamics of infectious diseases with herd immunity can be accurately modelled by allowing the transmission rate of infectious diseases to decline along with the reduction of contact infection risk after recovery or vaccination. Model B provides a credible framework for modelling infectious diseases with herd immunity in a randomly mixed population.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The model parameterizes the time varying reproduction number $R_t$ through a regression framework in which covariates can e.g be governmental interventions or changes in mobility patterns. This allows a joint fit across regions and partial pooling to share strength. This innovation was critical to our timely estimates of the impact of lockdown and other NPIs in the European epidemics, whose validity was borne out by the subsequent course of the epidemic. Our framework provides a fully generative model for latent infections and observations deriving from them, including deaths, cases, hospitalizations, ICU admissions and seroprevalence surveys. One issue surrounding our model's use during the COVID-19 pandemic is the confounded nature of NPIs and mobility. We use our framework to explore this issue.

Setting: An outpatient testing program in North Carolina. Patients: 20,177 individuals presenting between March 16 and September 3, 2020 for nasopharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA RT-PCR testing. Measurements: Self-reported symptoms, demographic characteristics, and exposure and travel histories. Results: Among 20,177 tested individuals, the proportion positive was 9.4% (95% CI, 9.0-9.8) and was higher for men, younger individuals, and racial/ethnic minorities (all P<0.05);the positivity proportion was higher for Hispanics (26.9;95% CI. 24.9-29.0) compared to Blacks (8.6%;95% CI, 7.6-9.7) or Whites (5.8%;95% CI, 5.4-6.3). Individuals reporting contact with a COVID-19 case had the highest positivity proportion (22.8%;95% CI, 21.5-24.1). Among the subset of 8,522 symptomatic adults who presented for testing after May 1, when complete symptom assessments were performed, SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR was detected in 1,116 (13.1%). Of the reported symptoms, loss of taste or smell was most strongly associated with SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection with an adjusted risk ratio of 3.88 (95% CI, 3.46-4.35). The presence of chills, fever, cough, aches, headache, fatigue and nasal congestion also significantly increased the risk of detecting SARS-CoV-2 RNA, while diarrhea or nausea/vomiting, although not uncommon, were significantly more common in those with a negative test result. Symptom combinations were frequent with 67.9% experiencing \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a54 symptoms, including 19.8% with \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a58 symptoms;report of greater than three symptoms increased the risk of SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.Limitation: The study was conducted at a single large testing facility. Conclusion: In a large outpatient population in the Southeastern US, several symptoms, most notably loss of taste or smell, and greater symptom burden were associated with detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Persons of color and those with who were a contact of a COVID-19 case were also more likely to test positive.

                "prompt": "The effects of border control and quarantine measures on the spread of COVID-19\nThe rapid expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of COVID-19 during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose different risks to community spread. We have developed an \"easy-to-use\" mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the cumulative number of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproduction number R0 = 2.92 and incubation period &#964; = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through an intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and global spread of COVID-19 in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, rates of hospitalisations and deaths were substantially lower than in the first and second waves MethodsIn the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study we obtained data from a random sample of 94,950 participants with valid throat and nose swab results by RT-PCR during round 18 (8 February to 1 March 2022). FindingsWe estimated a weighted mean SARS-CoV-2 prevalence of 2.88% (95% credible interval [CrI] 2.76-3.00), with a within-round reproduction number (R) overall of 0.94 (0{middle dot}91-0.96). While within-round weighted prevalence fell among children (aged 5 to 17 years) and adults aged 18 to 54 years, we observed a level or increasing weighted prevalence among those aged 55 years and older with an R of 1.04 (1.00-1.09). Among 1,195 positive samples with sublineages determined, only one (0.1% [0.0-0.5]) corresponded to AY.39 Delta sublineage and the remainder were Omicron: N=390, 32.7% (30.0-35.4) were BA.1; N=473, 39.6% (36.8-42.5) were BA.1.1; and N=331, 27.7% (25.2-30.4) were BA.2. We estimated an R additive advantage for BA.2 (vs BA.1 or BA.1.1) of 0.40 (0.36-0.43). The highest proportion of BA.2 among positives was found in London.

All 51 results were evaluated, with 18 deemed relevant. One study focused on Omicron case rates in South Africa during the early stage after the discovery of the new variant (November 2021), one described genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 in the USA (June - December 2021), one analysed clinical outcomes based on health records (January - December 2021), one described the results of whole-genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples collected in North Africa (March - December 2021), and one was from a previous REACT survey round (November - December 2021). The others focused on the mutation distribution of Omicron, disease severity, immune response, vaccine effectiveness, and prevalence in animal hosts. Added value of this studyWe analysed data from throat and nose swabs collected at home by a randomly selected sample of residents of England, aged 5 years and older, obtained during round 18 (8 February to 1 March 2022) of the REal-time Assessment of Community Transmission-1 (REACT-1) study. We estimated a weighted prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 of 2.88% (95% CrI 2.76-3.00) in England in February 2022, which was substantially lower than that estimated in January 2022 (4.41% [4.25-4.56]). The within-round dynamics differed by age group with weighted prevalence falling among children (aged 5 to 17 years) with an R of 0.79 (0.74-0.84) and adults aged 18 to 54 years with an R of 0.92 (0.89-0.96), in contrast to the level or increasing weighted prevalence among those aged 55 years and older with an R of 1.04 (1.00-1.09). Exponential models estimated a daily growth rate advantage of 0.12 (0.11-0.13) in the odds of BA.2 (vs BA.1 or BA.1.1) corresponding to an R additive advantage of 0.40 (0.36-0.43). Implications of all the available evidenceRandom community surveys of SARS-CoV-2 provide robust insights into transmission dynamics and identify groups at heightened risk of infection based on estimates of population prevalence that are unbiased by test-seeking behaviour or availability of tests. In England, replacement by BA.2 of other Omicron sublineages, the level or increasing rates of infection in older people and the uptick in hospitalisations in England toward the end of February 2022 require ongoing surveillance, both to monitor the levels of current (and future) SARS-CoV-2 variants and the risks of severe disease.

In this scenario, we investigate the temporal evolution and current status of the AIDS epidemic in Brazil. Specifically, we analyze records of annual absolute frequency of cases for more than 5000 cities for the first 33 years of the infection in Brazil. We found that (i) the annual absolute frequencies exhibit a logistic-type growth with an exponential regime in the first few years of the AIDS spreading; (ii) the actual reproduction number decaying as a power law; (iii) the distribution of the annual absolute frequencies among cities decays with a power law behavior; (iv) the annual absolute frequencies and the number of inhabitants have an allometric relationship; (v) the temporal evolution of the annual absolute frequencies have different profile depending on the average annual absolute frequencies in the cities. These findings yield a general quantitative description of the AIDS infection dynamics in Brazil since the beginning. They also provide clues about the effectiveness of treatment and control programs against the infection, that has had a different impact depending on the number of inhabitants of cities. In this framework, our results give insights into the overall dynamics of AIDS epidemic, which may contribute to select empirically accurate models.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This practice could negatively impact sleep by reducing exposure to daylight and physical activity. We examined subjective sleep quality in Baependi, a small rural town in Brazil during the COVID-19 quarantine order. METHODS: This sample is from the Baependi Heart Study, a family-based cohort of adults. Participants (n=800, 71% women, mean age 51.6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b115.6 years) completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) early in the COVID pandemic (April-May, 2020). They were also asked about their compliance to the quarantine order (yes/no). We compared sleep between quarantined (QT) and not-quarantined individuals (NQT). Longitudinal data was obtained from a subsample of 417 individuals who also completed a pre-COVID PSQI between January, 2010 and September, 2014. RESULTS: Individuals compliant with the quarantine had worse sleep quality than non-quarantined individuals [QT PSQI= 6.1 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.9), NQT PSQI= 5.0 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.5), p<0.01]. Stratified analysis showed that differences in PSQI scores between QT and NQT was greater for women [QT = 6.4 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b14), NQT = 5.2 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.7), p<0.01] and older people [QT = 6.6 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b10.1), NQT = 5.5 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.3), p=0.02]. Associations were attenuated after adjusting for age and gender. PSQI components demonstrated a higher sleep latency for the QT group in the full sample (p=0.02), women (p<0.01) and young (<50 years, p=0.03). Sleep duration was shorter in the QT young subsample (p=0.03). QT women also reported lower sleep efficiency (p=0.01) and greater use of sleep medication than NQT women (p<0.01). In the longitudinal subsample, PSQI scores were significantly higher during COVID than pre-pandemic [COVID= 5.7 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.8), pre-COVID= 5 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.3), p<0.01]. The significant change in PSQI was only observed in the QT participants [COVID= 5.9 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.7), pre-COVID= 5.2 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.4), p<0.01] and not NQT [COVID= 5 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.7), pre-COVID= 4.5 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13), p=0.12. CONCLUSION: Individuals who quarantined during COVID-19 had worse sleep quality than individuals who did not quarantine. Longitudinal comparison demonstrated that participants who quarantined had worse sleep quality during COVID compared to before to the pandemic.

Kinetics of antibodies transferred via COVID-19 convalescent plasma early in disease have not been characterized. METHODS: In this study, high-risk children were prospectively enrolled to receive high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma (>1:320 anti-spike IgG; Euroimmun). Passive transfer of antibodies and endogenous antibody production were serially evaluated for up to 2 months after transfusion. Commercial and research ELISA assays, virus neutralization assays, high-throughput phage-display assay utilizing a coronavirus epitope library, and pharmacokinetic analyses were performed. RESULTS: Fourteen high-risk children (median age, 7.5 years) received high-titer COVID-19 convalescent plasma, 9 children within 5 days (range, 2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01537 days) of symptom onset and 5 children within 4 days (range, 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01535 days) after exposure to SARS-CoV-2. There were no serious adverse events related to transfusion. Antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 were transferred from the donor to the recipient, but antibody titers declined by 14\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015321 days, with a 15.1-day half-life for spike protein IgG. Donor plasma had significant neutralization capacity, which was transferred to the recipient. However, as early as 30 minutes after transfusion, recipient plasma neutralization titers were 6.2% (range, 5.9%\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01536.7%) of donor titers. CONCLUSION: Convalescent plasma transfused to high-risk children appears to be safe, with expected antibody kinetics, regardless of weight or age. However, current use of convalescent plasma in high-risk children achieves neutralizing capacity, which may protect against severe disease but is unlikely to provide lasting protection.

Atomic force microscopy was applied to investigate the surface roughness of the LSCO coating, while in situ diffuse infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy was used to obtain the molecular understanding of adsorption and conversion. In addition, the influence of LSCO-coated substrates on the flame quenching distance was studied in a constant-volume combustion chamber. Investigations conclude that an LSCO coating leads to a reduction of flame quenching at low wall temperatures but a negligible effect at high temperatures.

Many Sub-Saharan African nations are now facing increasing numbers of cases of COVID-19 and there is a need to understand what levels of measures may be required to successfully reduce transmission. Methods: We collated epidemiological data along with information on key COVID-19 specific response policies and health system capacity estimates for services needed to treat COVID-19 patients in Senegal. We calibrated an age-structured SEIR model to these data to capture transmission dynamics accounting for demography, contact patterns, hospital capacity and disease severity. We simulated the impact of mitigation and suppression strategies focussed on reducing social contact rates. Results: Senegal acted promptly to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and as a result has reduced the reproduction number from 1.9 (95% CI 1.7-2.2) to 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.5), which has slowed but not fully interrupted transmission. We estimate that continued spread is likely to peak in October, and to overwhelm the healthcare system with an estimated 77,400 deaths(95% CI 55,270-100,700). Further reductions in contact rates to suppress transmission (Rt<1) could significantly reduce this burden on healthcare services and improve overall health outcomes. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Senegal has already significantly reduced transmission. Enhanced physical distancing measures and rapid scale up of hospital capacity is likely to be needed to reduce mortality and protect healthcare infrastructure from high levels of demand.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In spite of numerous more complicated models, we show how the qualitative features of the solution to the SIR and SEIR models continue to provide valuable public health insights in some scenarios. Using estimated COVID-19 data as of this date, the SEIR model shows that if it were possible to reduce R0 from 2.5 to 1.25 through social distancing and other measures, the maximum fraction of the population that would become infected at any particular time would drop from 17% to 4%, provided that all of the model assumptions are satisfied. Finally, we compare the classic SIR model with a recent stochastic model with favorable results. Since this comparison underscores the importance of underlying connectivity assumptions, we conclude with Monte-Carlo simulations with specific connectivity that reproduce the classical SIR model with standard incidence.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

There is currently no indication that feline- or canine-to-human transmission can occur, though there is rising evidence of the reverse. To explore the extent of animal-related transmission, we aggregated 17 case reports on confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections in animals as of 15 May 2020. All but two animals fully recovered and had only mild respiratory or digestive symptoms. Using data from probable cat-to-cat transmission in Wuhan, China, we estimated the basic reproduction number R0 under this scenario at 1.09 (95% confidence interval: 1.05, 1.13). This value is much lower than the R0 reported for humans and close to one, indicating that the sustained transmission between cats is unlikely to occur. Our results support the view that the pet owners and other persons with COVID-19 in close contact with animals should be cautious of the way they interact with them.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Evolutionary Entropy Determines Invasion Success in Emergent Epidemics\nBACKGROUND: Standard epidemiological theory claims that in structured populations competition between multiple pathogen strains is a deterministic process which is mediated by the basic reproduction number ([Image: see text]) of the individual strains. A new theory based on analysis, simulation and empirical study challenges this predictor of success. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that the quantity [Image: see text] is a valid predictor in structured populations only when size is infinite. In this article we show that when population size is finite the dynamics of infection by multi-strain pathogens is a stochastic process whose outcome can be predicted by evolutionary entropy, S, an information theoretic measure which describes the uncertainty in the infectious age of an infected parent of a randomly chosen new infective. Evolutionary entropy characterises the demographic stability or robustness of the population of infectives. This statistical parameter determines the duration of infection and thus provides a quantitative index of the pathogenicity of a strain. Standard epidemiological theory based on [Image: see text] as a measure of selective advantage is the limit as the population size tends to infinity of the entropic selection theory. The standard model is an approximation to the entropic selection theory whose validity increases with population size. CONCLUSION: An epidemiological analysis based on entropy is shown to explain empirical observations regarding the emergence of less pathogenic strains of human influenza during the antigenic drift phase. Furthermore, we exploit the entropy perspective to discuss certain epidemiological patterns of the current H1N1 swine 'flu outbreak.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Characterization of the second wave of COVID-19 in India\nThe second wave of COVID-19, which began in India around 11 February 2021, has hit the country hard with daily cases reaching nearly triple the first peak value as on 19 April 2021. The epidemic evolution in India is complex due to regional inhomogeneities and the spread of several coronavirus mutants. In this study, we characterize the virus spread in the ongoing second wave in India and its states until 19 April 2021, and also examine the dynamic evolution of the epidemic from the beginning of the outbreak. Variations in the effective reproduction number (Rt) are taken as quantifiable measures of virus transmissibility. Rt value for every state, including those with large rural populations, is greater than the self-sustaining threshold of 1. An exponential fit on recent data also shows that the infection rate is much higher than in the first wave. Subsequently, characteristics of COVID-19 spread are analysed region-wise, by estimating test positivity rates (TPRs) and case fatality rates (CFRs). Very high TPR values for several states present an alarming situation. CFR values are lower than those in the first wave, but are recently showing signs of increase as the healthcare system is being over-stretched with the surge in infections. Preliminary estimates with a classical epidemiological model suggest that the peak for the second wave could occur around mid-May 2021, with daily count exceeding 0.4 million. The study strongly suggests that an effective administrative intervention is needed to arrest the rapid growth of the epidemic.

Given the importance to assess the evolution and transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 and to forecast the next scenario of the pandemic, mainly in countries with limited healthcare systems, we estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, and a possible scenario for this pandemic in the region. Subject and methods: We estimated the reproductive number (R0) of SARS-CoV-2 in its first outbreak stage in the northwestern region of Himalaya, India, and we also predicted new daily cases for the next 90 days using different R0, testing a plausible end of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Results: Our results showed a considerable increase in the number of cases, but with a tendency to asymptote. Anantnag, Bandipora, Baramulla, Shopian, and Srinagar districts showed more than 100 cases and Kulgam and Kathua districts showed strong growth of the number of cases from the beginning of May, without a tendency to normalization. The estimated R0 for the J&K region was 1.041; but by decreasing the RO by 10, 25, and 50%, we observed a great decrease in the daily number of new cases, especially by decreasing by 50%. Conclusion: In this study, we indicate positive effects of the preventive measures, such as lockdown and social distancing, taken in the J&K region, showing a stabilization of the growth curves of new cases of SARS-CoV-2, which tends to a strong decrease over time as the R0 decreases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Despite administrative efforts at mitigation and preventive measures, the large congregation of students within close quarters has caused public health concerns. In this paper, we examine college reopenings' association with changes in human mobility within campuses and in COVID-19 incidence in the counties of the campuses, over a two-week period before and after college reopenings. To estimate the daily reproduction number (Rt), we used a Bayesian framework. Using a difference-in-differences design comparing areas with a college campus, before and after reopening, to areas without a campus, we find that after college reopenings for face-to-face instruction, COVID-19 incidence in the county increased on average by a statistically significant 0.024 per thousand residents, following increases in mobility on campus. Similarly, we estimated increased transmission locally after reopening, with a rising trend in Rt. The increase in cases was larger in counties with colleges that drew students from areas with increasing incidence rates.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We apply the SIRD epidemiology model for estimating the basic reproduction number of the new coronavirus disease for multiple different countries. Methods: For estimating of the basic reproduction number values, we fit the SIRD model using the Runge-Kutta simulation method in addition to the analytical solution of parts of the model. We use the collected data of the new coronavirus pandemic reported up to date July 30, 2020 in India, the Syrian Arab Republic, the United States, France, Nigeria, Yemen, China and Russia. Results: We find that the basic reproduction numbers of the new coronavirus disease are located in the range [1.0011-2.7936] for the different location countries and the values of the ratio between the rate of recovery and the rate of mortality are between 1.5905 for Yemen and 44.0805 for Russia. Also, we find the dates of the actual decreasing of Covid-19 cases in five countries. Conclusions: We find that the basic reproductive number is between 1.0011 for the smallest value and 2.7936 for the greatest value. The most important thing is that the values of the basic reproduction number of the new coronavirus disease in all considered countries are more than one which means that the new coronavirus disease is epidemic in all of considered countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this paper, we construct an SVEIQHR-type mathematical model for the disease's spread in the country, which incorporates as parameters the rates of the above interventions, as well as the vaccine's efficacy. We determine the model's equilibria and basic reproduction number. Using the model, we formulate strategies by which the interventions should be realised in order to optimise their impact. The results show that, in a disease-free state, when the number of new cases rises, the best strategy is to implement social restrictions, whereas in an endemic state, if a near-lockdown policy is undesirable, carrying out vaccinations is the best strategy; however, efforts should be aimed not primarily towards increasing the vaccination rate, but towards the use of high-efficacy vaccines.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

First, the well-posedness of the multi-scale model is discussed, followed by the stability analysis of the equilibrium points. The disease-free equilibrium point is shown to be globally asymptotically stable for $R_0<1$. When $R_0$ exceeds unity, a unique infected equilibrium exists, and the system is found to undergo a forward (trans-critical) bifurcation at $R_0=1$. Two parameter heat plots are also done to find the parameter combinations for which the equilibrium points are stable. The parameters $\\beta, \\pi$ and $\\Lambda$ are found to be most sensitive to $R_0$. The influence of within-host sub-model parameter on the between-host sub-model variables is numerically illustrated. The spread of infection in a community is shown to be influenced by within-host level sub-model parameters, such as the production of viral particles by infected cells $(\\alpha)$, the clearance rate of infected cells by the immune system $(x)$, and the clearance rate of viral particles by the immune system $(y)$. The comparative effectiveness of the three health interventions (antiviral drugs, immunomodulators, and generalized social distancing) for COVID-19 infection was examined using the effective reproductive number $R_E$ as an indicator of the effectiveness of the interventions.

We developed an ordinary differential equation-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with Bayesian underpinning to estimate the main parameter of R0 determined by transmission coefficients, incubation period, and the recovery rate. Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) estimation method was used to tackle the parameters of uncertainty resulting from the outbreak of COVID-19 given a small cohort of the cruise ship. The extended stratified SEIR model was also proposed to elucidate the heterogeneity of transmission route by the level of deck with passengers and crews. With the application of the overall model, R0 was estimated as high as 5.70 (95% credible interval: 4.23-7.79). The entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 63% (95% credible interval: 60-66%) infected passengers. With the deck-specific SEIR model, the heterogeneity of R0 estimates by each deck was noted. The estimated R0 figures were 5.18 for passengers (5-14 deck), mainly from the within-deck transmission, and 2.46 for crews (2-4 deck), mainly from the between-deck transmission. Modelling the dynamic of COVID-19 on the cruise ship not only provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine but also elucidates the relative contributions of different transmission modes on the cruise ship though the deck-stratified SEIR model.

It would be desirable to rapidly characterize such outbreaks and develop accurate projections of their duration and cumulative size even when limited preliminary data are available. Here we develop a mathematical model to aid public health authorities in tracking the expansion and contraction of outbreaks with explicit representation of factors (other than population immunity) that may slow epidemic growth. METHODOLOGY: The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model is a parsimonious function that uses the basic reproduction number R(0), along with a discounting factor to project the growth of outbreaks using only basic epidemiological information (e.g., daily incidence counts). PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Compared to simulated data, IDEA provides highly accurate estimates of total size and duration for a given outbreak when R(0) is low or moderate, and also identifies turning points or new waves. When tested with an outbreak of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), the model generates estimated incidence at the i+1(th) serial interval using data from the i(th) serial interval within an average of 20% of actual incidence. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: This model for communicable disease outbreaks provides rapid assessments of outbreak growth and public health interventions. Further evaluation in the context of real-world outbreaks will establish the utility of IDEA as a tool for front-line epidemiologists.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Uncertainty in these estimates was more constrained than standard methods, particularly for smaller outbreaks informed by the population-level model. We further estimated that intervention led to 61% (52%\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369%) of all potential cases being averted within the LTHC facilities, or 75% (68%\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015379%) when using a model with multi-level intervention effect.

Cases have been exported to other Chinese cities, as well as internationally, threatening to trigger a global outbreak. Here, we provide an estimate of the size of the epidemic in Wuhan on the basis of the number of cases exported from Wuhan to cities outside mainland China and forecast the extent of the domestic and global public health risks of epidemics, accounting for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. Methods We used data from Dec 31, 2019, to Jan 28, 2020, on the number of cases exported from Wuhan internationally (known days of symptom onset from Dec 25, 2019, to Jan 19, 2020) to infer the number of infections in Wuhan from Dec 1, 2019, to Jan 25, 2020. Cases exported domestically were then estimated. We forecasted the national and global spread of 2019-nCoV, accounting for the effect of the metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan and surrounding cities, which began Jan 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324, 2020. We used data on monthly flight bookings from the Official Aviation Guide and data on human mobility across more than 300 prefecture-level cities in mainland China from the Tencent database. Data on confirmed cases were obtained from the reports published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Serial interval estimates were based on previous studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered metapopulation model was used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credibile interval (CrI). Findings In our baseline scenario, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for 2019-nCoV was 2\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b768 (95% CrI 2\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b747\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b786) and that 75 815 individuals (95% CrI 37 304\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153130 330) have been infected in Wuhan as of Jan 25, 2020. The epidemic doubling time was 6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b74 days (95% CrI 5\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b78\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01537\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71). We estimated that in the baseline scenario, Chongqing, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen had imported 461 (95% CrI 227\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153805), 113 (57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153193), 98 (49\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153168), 111 (56\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153191), and 80 (40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153139) infections from Wuhan, respectively. If the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV were similar everywhere domestically and over time, we inferred that epidemics are already growing exponentially in multiple major cities of China with a lag time behind the Wuhan outbreak of about 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532 weeks. Interpretation Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, other major Chinese cities are probably sustaining localised outbreaks. Large cities overseas with close transport links to China could also become outbreak epicentres, unless substantial public health interventions at both the population and personal levels are implemented immediately. Independent self-sustaining outbreaks in major cities globally could become inevitable because of substantial exportation of presymptomatic cases and in the absence of large-scale public health interventions. Preparedness plans and mitigation interventions should be readied for quick deployment globally.

Human-to-human transmissions, as well as asymptomatic transmissions of the infection, have been confirmed. As of April 03, 2020, public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 is potentially under control. We compiled a daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 2020. Understanding the characteristics of spatial clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R(0) is critical in effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. Considering this, the prefectures were grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning techniques. Subsequently, we performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to estimate the revised R(0) among different regions. Finally, our results indicate that the impact of temperature and demographic factors on virus transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions will help in prevention planning in an ongoing global pandemic, prioritizing segments of a given community/region for action and providing a visual aid in designing prevention strategies for a specific geographic region.

To mitigate the impact of this disease, these countries implemented intervention measures including self-isolation, the closure of schools, banning of public gatherings, social distancing and border closures. Several epidemiological models have been used to improve our understanding of COVID-19 trajectory. This has helped inform decisions about pandemic planning, resource allocation, implementation of other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). This study presents estimates of the cases and fatalities due to COVID-19 and attempts to forecast the impact of governmental interventions in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda. . Methods: We used time series COVID-19 case and mortality data collated from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) repository and an extended susceptible-infected-removed (eSIR) compartmental model incorporating quarantine and vaccination compartments to account for transmission dynamics and vaccine-induced immunity over time. The predication accuracy was evaluated using the root mean square error and mean absolute error. Results: The number of new and confirmed cases show an exponential trend since March 02 2020. The mean basic reproductive number (R 0 ) was between 1.32 (95% CI, 1.17 - 1.49) in Rwanda and 8.52 (95% CI: 3.73 - 14.10) in Kenya, under exponential growth. There would be a total of 115,505 (95% CI:109,999 - 121,264), 7,072,584 (6,945,505 - 7,203,084), 18,248,566(18,100,299 - 18,391,438), 410,599 (399,776 - 421528), 386,020 (376,478 - 396244), 107,265 (95,757 - 119982), 3,145,602 (3,089,070 - 3205017) infected cases under the current country blockade by January 16/2022 in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda respectively. We show that the low apparent morbidity and mortality observed in EACs, is likely biased by underestimation of infected and mortality cases. Conclusion: The current NPI measures can effectively reduce further spread of COVID-19 and should be strengthened. The observed reduction in R 0 is consistent with intervention measures implemented in EACs, in particular, lockdowns and roll-out of vaccination programmes.

Patient isolation, lockdown, quarantine, social distancing, changes in health care provision, and mass screening are the most common non-pharmaceutical PHIs to cope with the epidemic. However, there is neither systematic evidence on the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical PHIs in controlling the COVID-19 nor on how these interventions work in different contexts. Therefore, in this study we will address two main objectives: 1) to assess the effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical PHIs in controlling the spread of COVID-19 using a systematic review and meta-analyses; 2) to explore why, how, and for whom these interventions work using a realist review. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This review study has two main phases. In the first phase of this study, we will extract data from two main types of studies including quasi-experimental studies (such as quasi-randomized trials, controlled before-after studies (CBAs) and interrupted time series studies (ITSs)) and observational studies (such as cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional studies), written in the English language. We will explore effectiveness of the non-pharmaceutical PHIs targeted either suppression or mitigation strategies (or a combination of both) in controlling the COVID-19 epidemics in the community level. Effectiveness will be considered as the changes in mortality rate, incidence rate, basic reproduction number rate, morbidity rate, rates of hospitalization, rates of intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization, and other health outcomes where possible. We will perform random-effects meta-analyses, if possible, using CMA software. In the second phase, we will conduct a realist review to find out how, why, for whom, and in what circumstances the non-pharmaceutical PHIs work. At the realist review, we will identify and explore Context-Mechanism-Outcome configurations to provide a robust explanation on the effectiveness of the interventions in different contexts using Pawson's 5-step realist review template including: \"clarify scope; search for evidence; appraise primary studies and extract data; synthesize evidence and draw conclusions; and disseminate, implement and evaluate\". Although the steps are presented in a linear manner, in practice, we will follow them in iterative stages to fill any potential overlap. DISCUSSION: The findings of this research will provide a crucial insight into how and in which context the non-pharmaceutical PHIs work in controlling the spread of COVID-19. Conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis in line with a realist review will allow us to draw a robust conclusion on the effects and the way in which the interventions work. Understanding the role of contextual factors in the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical PHIs and the mechanism of this process could enable policymakers to implement appropriate policies and manage the COVID-19 epidemics more efficiently.

We describe a new approach that forecasts the number of incident cases in the near future given past occurrences using only a small number of assumptions. Methods: Our approach to forecasting future COVID-19 cases involves 1) modeling the observed incidence cases using a Poisson distribution for the daily incidence number, and a gamma distribution for the series interval; 2) estimating the effective reproduction number assuming its value stays constant during a short time interval; and 3) drawing future incidence cases from their posterior distributions, assuming that the current transmission rate will stay the same, or change by a certain degree. Results: We apply our method to predicting the number of new COVID-19 cases in a single state in the U.S. and for a subset of counties within the state to demonstrate the utility of this method at varying scales of prediction. Our method produces reasonably accurate results when the effective reproduction number is distributed similarly in the future as in the past. Large deviations from the predicted results can imply that a change in policy or some other factors have occurred that have dramatically altered the disease transmission over time.

In addition, the experiences gained and lessons learned from China have the potential to provide evidence to support other metropolitan areas and large cities outside China with emerging cases. We used data reported from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020, to fit a model of infection, estimate the likely number of infections in four high-risk metropolitan areas based on the number of cases reported, and increase the understanding of the COVID-19 spread pattern. Considering the effect of the official quarantine regulations and travel restrictions for China, which began January 23~24, 2020, we used the daily travel intensity index from the Baidu Maps app to roughly simulate the level of restrictions and estimate the proportion of the quarantined population. A group of SEIR model statistical parameters were estimated using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods and fitting on the basis of reported data. As a result, we estimated that the basic reproductive number, R0, was 2.91 in Beijing, 2.78 in Shanghai, 2.02 in Guangzhou, and 1.75 in Shenzhen based on the data from January 24, 2020, to February 23, 2020. In addition, we inferred the prediction results and compared the results of different levels of parameters. For example, in Beijing, the predicted peak number of cases was approximately 466 with a peak time of February 29, 2020; however, if the city were to implement different levels (strict, mild, or weak) of travel restrictions or regulation measures, the estimation results showed that the transmission dynamics would change and that the peak number of cases would differ by between 56% and ~159%. We concluded that public health interventions would reduce the risk of the spread of COVID-19 and that more rigorous control and prevention measures would effectively contain its further spread but that the risk will increase when businesses and social activities return to normal before the end of the epidemic.

Therefore, accurately predicting the dynamics of the pandemic can be very beneficial. Two main elements required for developing reliable predictions include: (1) a predictive model and (2) an indicator of the current condition and status of the pandemic. As a pandemic indicator, we used the effective reproduction number (Rt), which is defined as the number of new infections transmitted by a single contagious individual in a population that may no longer be fully susceptible. To bring the pandemic under control, Rt must be less than one. To eliminate the pandemic, Rt should be close to zero. Therefore, this value may serve as a strong indicator of the current status of the pandemic. For a predictive model, we used graph neural networks (GNNs), a method that combines graphical analysis with the structure of neural networks. We developed two types of GNN models, including: (1) graph-theory-based neural networks (GTNN) and (2) neighborhood-based neural networks (NGNN). The nodes in both graphs indicated individual states in the United States. While the GTNN model's edges document functional connectivity between states, those in the NGNN model link neighboring states to one another. We trained both models with Rt numbers collected over the previous four days and asked them to predict the following day for all states in the United States. The performance of these models was evaluated with the datasets that included Rt values reflecting conditions from 22 January through 26 November 2020 (before the start of COVID-19 vaccination in the United States). To determine the efficiency, we compared the results of two models with each other and with those generated by a baseline Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. The results indicated that the GTNN model outperformed both the NGNN and LSTM models for predicting Rt.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Since the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic started, many methods and online dashboards have sprung up to monitor this number.

Here, we present a method for near real time monitoring of Re, applied to epidemic data from 170 countries. We thoroughly validate the method on simulated data, and present an intuitive web interface for interactive data exploration. We show that in the majority of countries the estimated Re dropped below 1 only after the introduction of major non-pharmaceutical interventions. For Europe, Asia, and North America we found that the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions was associated with reductions in the effective reproductive number. Globally, we found that relaxing non-pharmaceutical interventions did not fully revert Re values to their original levels. Generally, our framework is useful both to inform governments and the general public on the status of the epidemic in their country, as well as a source for detailed comparison between countries and in relation to local public health policies and external covariates such as mobility, behavioural, or weather data.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Our economic model is designed to address the unique features of the COVID-19 pandemic. Social distancing measures affect both supply and demand, and input-output constraints play a key role in restricting economic output. Standard models for production functions are not adequate to model the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts conducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry are absolutely necessary for production over a two month period. Our model also includes inventory dynamics and feedback between unemployment and consumption. We demonstrate that economic outcomes are very sensitive to the choice of production function, show how supply constraints cause strong network effects, and find some counter-intuitive effects, such as that reopening only a few industries can actually lower aggregate output. Occupation-specific data and contact surveys allow us to estimate how different industries affect the transmission rate of the disease. We investigate six different re-opening scenarios, presenting our best estimates for the increase in R0 and the increase in GDP. Our results suggest that there is a reasonable compromise that yields a relatively small increase in R0 and delivers a substantial boost in economic output. This corresponds to a situation in which all non-consumer facing industries reopen, schools are open only for workers who need childcare, and everyone who can work from home continues to work from home.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Rigorous control measures were introduced and could only be relaxed once the outbreak was declared over. Each day after the apparent outbreak end, we estimated the risk of future cases occurring in order to inform decision-making. METHODS: Probabilistic transmission networks were reconstructed, and transmission parameters (the reproduction number R and overdispersion parameter k) were estimated. The reporting delay during the outbreak was estimated (Scenario 1). In addition, a counterfactual scenario with less effective interventions characterized by a longer reporting delay was considered (Scenario 2). Each day, the risk of future cases was estimated under both scenarios. RESULTS: The values of R and k were estimated to be 1.30 ((95% credible interval (CI) 0.57-3.80) and 0.38 (95% CI 0.12-1.20), respectively. The mean reporting delays considered were 2.5 days (Scenario 1) and 7.8 days (Scenario 2). Following the final case, ttthe inferred probability of future cases occurring declined more quickly in Scenario 1 than Scenario 2.

In this setting, the virus' basic reproductive number R_0, which characterizes the average number of secondary cases generated by each primary case, takes on a significant importance in the quantification of the potential scope of the pandemic. Yet, in most models, R_0 is assumed to be a universal constant for the virus across outbreak clusters and populations -- thus neglecting the inherent variability of the transmission process due to varying population densities, demographics, temporal factors, etc. In fact, it can be shown that the reproduction number is highly variable. Considering its expected value thus leads to biased or loose results in the reported predictive scenarios, especially as these are tailored to a given country or region. The goal of this paper is the examination of the impact of the reproductive number R's variability on important output metrics, and the percolation of this variability in projected scenarios so as to provide uncertainty quantification. In this perspective, instead of considering a single R_0, we consider a distribution of reproductive numbers R and devise a simple Bayesian hierarchical model that builds upon current methods for estimating the R to integrate its heterogeneity. We then simulate the spread of the epidemic, and the impact of different social distancing strategies using a probabilistic framework that models hospital occupancy. This shows the strong impact of this added variability on the reported results. We emphasize that our goal is not to replace benchmark methods for estimating the basic reproductive numbers, but rather to discuss the importance of the impact of R's heterogeneity on uncertainty quantification for the current COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Hong Kong had a massive influx of travellers from mainland China, where the outbreak began, during the early expansion period coinciding with the Lunar New Year festival; however, the spread of the virus has been relatively limited even without imposing severe control measures, such as a full city lockdown. Understanding how quarantine measures in Hong Kong were effective in limiting community spread can provide us with valuable insights into how to suppress an outbreak. However, challenges exist in evaluating the effects of quarantine on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong due to the fact that the effects of border control have to be also taken into account. Methods: We have developed a two-layered susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model which can estimate the effects of quarantine on virus transmissibility after stratifying infections into imported and subsequent community infections, in a region closely connected to the outbreak's source. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed case data with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong, together with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from Wuhan and mainland China. After model fitting, epidemiological parameters and the timing of the start of quarantine for infected cases were estimated. Results: The model estimated that the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), achieved through quarantining infected cases -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 - 3.88) relative to symptom onset, with an estimated incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30 - 9.47). However, if delaying the quarantine start by more than 1.43 days, the reproduction number would be greater than one, making community spread more likely. The model also determined the timing of the start of quarantine necessary in order to suppress an outbreak in the presence of population immunity. Conclusion: The results suggest that the early quarantine for infected cases before symptom onset is a key factor to prevent COVID-19 outbreak.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

On the other hand, interval censoring-based methods are able to utilize a much larger set of traveling data but may encounter biased sampling problems. The distribution of generation time is usually approximated by observed serial intervals. However, it may result in a biased estimation of generation time, especially when the disease is infectious during incubation.

The numerical analysis reveals the impact of the fractional-order derivative on the various classes of the disease model as one can get reliable information at any integer or non-integer value of the fractional operator. The results of the simulation predict the COVID-19 cases in Ghana. Analysis of the optimal control reveals social distancing leads to an increase in the susceptible population, whereas vaccination reduces the number of susceptible individuals.

However, the limited pace at which the vaccine can be administered motivates the question, to what extent must we continue to adhere to social intervention measures such as mask wearing and social distancing? To address this question, we develop a mathematical model of COVID-19 spread incorporating both vaccine dynamics and socio-epidemiological parameters. We use this model to study two important measures of disease control and eradication, the effective reproductive number $R_t$ and the peak intensive care unit (ICU) caseload, over three key parameters: social measure adherence, vaccination rate, and vaccination coverage. Our results suggest that, due to the slow pace of vaccine administration, social measures must be maintained by a large proportion of the population until a sufficient proportion of the population becomes vaccinated for the pandemic to be eradicated. By contrast, with reduced adherence to social measures, hospital ICU cases will greatly exceed capacity, resulting in increased avoidable loss of life. These findings highlight the complex interplays involved between vaccination and social protective measures, and indicate the practical importance of continuing with extent social measures while vaccines are scaled up to allow the development of the herd immunity needed to end or control SARS-CoV-2 sustainably.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: We collected data on social contacts among school-aged children in the California Bay Area and developed an individual-based transmission model to simulate transmission of the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 in schools. We evaluated the additional infections in students and teachers/staff resulting over a 128-day semester from in-school instruction compared to remote instruction when various NPIs (mask use, cohorts, and weekly testing of students/teachers) were implemented, across various community-wide vaccination coverages (50%, 60%, 70%), and student (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a512 years) and teacher/staff vaccination coverages (50% - 95%). FINDINGS: At 70% vaccination coverage, universal masking reduced infections by >57% among students. Masking plus 70% vaccination coverage enabled achievement of <50 excess cases per 1,000 students/teachers, but stricter risk tolerances, such as <25 excess infections per 1,000 students/teachers, required a cohort approach in elementary and middle school populations. In the absence of NPIs, increasing the vaccination coverage of community members from 50% to 70% or elementary teachers from 70% to 95% reduced the excess rate of infection among elementary school students attributable to school transmission by 24% and 37%, respectively. INTERPRETATIONS: Amidst Delta variant circulation, we found that schools are not inherently low risk, yet can be made so with high community vaccination coverages and masking. Vaccination of adults protects unvaccinated children. FUNDING: National Science Foundation grant no. 2032210; National Institutes of Health grant nos.

Recognizing the outbreak, concerted efforts were made to control viral spread, which included mosquito control, public announcement of the outbreak, and a total ban on entering the park. We sought to assess the effectiveness of these control measures. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a mathematical model to describe the transmission dynamics. Using dates of exposure and illness onset, we categorized cases into three groups according to the availability of these datasets. The infection process was parametrically modeled by generation, and convolution of the infection process and the incubation period was fitted to the data. By estimating the effective reproduction number, we determined that the effect of dengue risk communication together with mosquito control from 28 August 2014 was insufficiently large to lower the reproduction number to below 1. However, once Yoyogi Park was closed on 4 September, the value of the effective reproduction number began to fall below 1, and the associated relative reduction in the effective reproduction number was estimated to be 20%\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015360%.

It is essential that appropriate disease control activities are planned and implemented in a timely manner. Thailand was one of the first countries outside China to be affected with subsequent importation and domestic spread in most provinces in the country. METHOD: A key ingredient to guide planning and implementation of public health measures is a metric of transmissibility which represents the infectiousness of a disease. Ongoing policies can utilize this information to plan appropriately with updated estimates of disease transmissibility. Therefore we present descriptive analyses and preliminary statistical estimation of reproduction numbers over time and space to facilitate disease control activities in Thailand. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproduction number for COVID-19 during the study ranged from 2.23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01535.90, with a mean of 3.75. We also tracked disease dynamics over time using temporal and spatiotemporal reproduction numbers. The results suggest that the outbreak was under control since the middle of April. After the boxing stadium and entertainment venues, the numbers of new cases had increased and spread across the country. DISCUSSION: Although various scenarios about assumptions were explored in this study, the real situation was difficult to determine given the limited data. More thorough mathematical modelling would be helpful to improve the estimation of transmissibility metrics for emergency preparedness as more epidemiological and clinical information about this new infection becomes available. However, the results can be used to guide interventions directly and to help parameterize models to predict the impact of these interventions.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the case number, and trajectory of cases, differs considerably between states. We show that early non-pharmaceutical, government actions, were the most important determinant of epidemic dynamics.

The intensity of the pandemic on a given territory is efficiently measured by the reproduction number, quantifying the rate of growth of daily new infections. Recently, estimates for the time evolution of the reproduction number were produced using an inverse problem formulation with a nonsmooth functional minimization. While it was designed to be robust to the limited quality of the Covid19 data (outliers, missing counts), the procedure lacks the ability to output credibility interval based estimates. This remains a severe limitation for practical use in actual pandemic monitoring by epidemiologists that the present work aims to overcome by use of Monte Carlo sampling. After interpretation of the functional into a Bayesian framework, several sampling schemes are tailored to adjust the nonsmooth nature of the resulting posterior distribution. The originality of the devised algorithms stems from combining a Langevin Monte Carlo sampling scheme with Proximal operators. Performance of the new algorithms in producing relevant credibility intervals for the reproduction number estimates and denoised counts are compared. Assessment is conducted on real daily new infection counts made available by the Johns Hopkins University. The interest of the devised monitoring tools are illustrated on Covid19 data from several different countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

An important step to overcoming the spread of the COVID-19 is understanding its epidemiology through mathematical modeling intervention. Knowledge of epidemic dynamics patterns is an important part of making timely decisions and preparing hospitals for the outbreak peak. In this study, we developed the susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) model, which incorporates the key epidemiological parameters to model and estimate the long-term spread of the COVID-19.

However, it is easy to confuse COVID-19 with seasonal influenza in preliminary clinical diagnosis. In this study, the differences between influenza and COVID-19 in epidemiological features, clinical manifestations, comorbidities and pathogen biology were comprehensively compared and analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 causes a higher proportion of pneumonia (90.67 vs. 17.07%) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (12.00 vs. 0%) than influenza A virus. The proportion of leukopenia for influenza patients was 31.71% compared with 12.00% for COVID-19 patients (P = 0.0096). The creatinine and creatine kinase were significantly elevated when there were COVID-19 patients. The basic reproductive number (R0) for SARS-CoV-2 is 2.38 compared with 1.28 for seasonal influenza A virus. The mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 1.12 \u00c3\u0192\u00e2\u20ac\u201d 10-3 to 6.25 \u00c3\u0192\u00e2\u20ac\u201d 10-3, while seasonal influenza virus has a lower evolutionary rate (0.60-2.00 \u00c3\u0192\u00e2\u20ac\u201d 10-6).

The virus' main protease is a dimeric enzyme that has only recently begun to be thoroughly described, opening the door for virtual screening more broadly. Here, a PAIN-filtered flavonoid database was screened against four sites of the protease: a free (normal) conformation of the Substrate Binding Site (NSBS), an induced-fit state of the SBS (ISBS), a Dimerization Site (DS) and a Cryptic Site (CS).

The daily trend in reported cases has been rapidly rising in Latin America since March 2020 with the great majority of the cases reported in Brazil followed by Peru as of April 15th, 2020. Although Peru implemented a range of social distancing measures soon after the confirmation of its first case on March 6th, 2020, the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to accumulate in this country. We assessed the early COVID-19 transmission dynamics and the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima, Peru. We estimated the reproduction number, R, during the early transmission phase in Lima from the daily series of imported and autochthonous cases by the date of symptoms onset as of March 30th, 2020. We also assessed the effect of social distancing interventions in Lima by generating short-term forecasts grounded on the early transmission dynamics before interventions were put in place. Prior to the implementation of the social distancing measures in Lima, the local incidence curve by the date of symptoms onset displays near exponential growth dynamics with the mean scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.96 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.0) and the reproduction number at 2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5). Our analysis indicates that school closures and other social distancing interventions have helped slow down the spread of the novel coronavirus, with the nearly exponential growth trend shifting to an approximately linear growth trend soon after the broad scale social distancing interventions were put in place by the government. While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate in Lima, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to strengthen social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We infer that the number of latent infections of GEC is about 7.47*10^5 (95% CI: 7.32*10^5-7.62*10^5) as of April 2, 2020. We predict that the peak of infections in hospitals of GEC may reach 3.00*10^6 on the present trajectory, i.e., if the population size for pathogen transmission and epidemic parameters remains unchanged. If the control intensity is strengthened, e.g., 50% reduction or 75% reduction of the population size for pathogen transmission, the peak would decline to 1.84*10^6, 1.27*10^6, respectively.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, little is known about the transmission risk of SARS-CoV-2 on confined vehicles, such as airplanes and trains. Based on the itinerary and epidemiological data of COVID-19 cases and close contacts among 9,265 airline passengers on 291 airplanes and 29,335 passengers on 830 high-speed trains in China from December 20, 2019 to March 17, 2020, we estimated that the upper bound of overall attack rate of COVID-19 among passengers was 0.60% (95% confidence interval: 0.43%-0.84%) for airplanes and 0.35% (0.28%-0.44%) for trains departing from Wuhan before its lockdown, respectively. The reproduction number during travel ranged from 0.12 to 0.19 on airplanes and from 0.07 to 0.12 on trains, with the risk varying by seat distance from the index case and joint travel time, but the difference in risk was not significant between the types of aircraft and train. Overall, the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on planes and high-speed trains with high efficiency air filtration devices was relatively low. Our findings improve understanding of COVID-19 spread during travel and may inform response efforts, such as lifting travel restrictions, and resuming transportation in the pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

As a result, multiple governments, including national and local levels of government, went through several degrees of social distancing measures. The decision process about when to lift social distancing measures requires evidence of incidence decrease, available capacity in the health systems to absorb eventual epidemic waves, and serological prevalence studies designed to estimate the proportion of individuals with antibody protection. The trend criterium usually given by the effective reproduction number might be misguided if there are significant delays for reporting cases. For instance, the reproduction number for Niteroi, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, went down from a value of approximately 3 to little more than 1. Even with all measures, the reproduction number did not get below R0<1, which would demonstrate a more controlled scenario.

In this study, there were 1477 confirmed, probable and suspected cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 for Kermanshah from 22 February to 9 April. The close contacts of the confirmed cases were identified using telephone follow up of patients and their contacts. The SI distribution was used as an alternative.

The aim of this research is to provide a high-resolution global model of the pandemic that overcomes the problem of biased country-level data on the number of infected cases. To achieve this we propose a novel SIR-type metapopulation transmission model and a set of analytically derived model parameters. We used them to perform a simulation of the disease spread with help of the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEAM) framework embedding actual population densities, commute patterns and long-range travel networks. The simulation starts on 17 November 2019 with the index case (presymptomatic, yet infectious) in Wuhan, China, and results in an accurate prediction of the number of diagnosed cases after 154 days in multiple countries across five continents. In addition, the model outcome shows high compliance with the results of a random screening test conducted on pregnant women in the New York area. Methods: We have built a modified SIR metapopulation transmission model and parameterized it analytically either by setting the values of the parameters based on the literature, or by assuming their plausible values. We compared our results with the number of diagnosed cases in twenty selected countries, ones which provide reliable statistics but differ substantially in terms of strength and speed of undertaken Non-Drug Interventions. The obtained 95% confidence intervals for the predictions are in agreement with the empirical data. Results: The parameters that successfully model the pandemic are: the basic reproduction number R0, 4.4; a latent non-infectious period of 1.1. days followed by 4.6 days of the presymptomatic infectious period; the probability of developing severe symptoms, 0.01; the probability of being diagnosed when presenting severe symptoms of 0.6; the probability of diagnosis for cases with mild symptoms or asymptomatic, 0.001. Discussion: Parameters that successfully reproduce the observed number of cases indicate that both R0and the prevalence of the virus might be underestimated. This is in concordance with the newest research on undocumented COVID-19 cases. Consequently, the actual mortality rate is putatively lower than estimated. Confirmation of the pandemic characteristic by further refinement of the model and screening tests is crucial for developing an effective strategy for the global epidemiological crisis.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In the TOGETHER randomized platform clinical trial for acutely symptomatic patients with COVID-19, we assessed the efficacy of fluvoxamine vs. placebo in preventing either extended emergency room observation or hospitalization due to COVID-19. Herein, we report the preliminary findings. MethodsThis placebo-controlled, randomized, adaptive, platform trial conducted among symptomatic Brazilian adults confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 included eligible patients with a known risk factor for progression to severe disease. Patients were randomly assigned to either fluvoxamine (100 mg twice daily for 10 days) or placebo. The primary endpoint was a composite outcome of emergency room observation for >6 hours or hospitalization from COVID-19 up to 28 days post randomization using intention to treat. Modified intention to treat (mITT) explored patients receiving at least 24 hours of treatment before a primary outcome event. Secondary outcomes included viral clearance at day 7, time to hospitalization, mortality, and adverse drug reactions. We used a Bayesian analytic framework to determine effects along with probability of success of intervention compared to placebo. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04727424) and is ongoing. FindingsThe study team screened 9020 potential participants for this trial. The trial was initiated on June 2, 2020, with the current protocol reporting randomization from January 15, 2021 to August 6th 2021, when the trial arms were stopped for superiority. A total of 3238 patients were allocated to fluvoxamine (n=739), placebo (n=733) and other treatments (n=1766). Herein, we report the effectiveness of fluvoxamine vs. a concurrent placebo control. The average age of participants was 50 years (range 18-102 years); 57% were female. The proportion of patients observed in an emergency room for >6 hours or admitted to hospital due to COVID-19 was lower for the fluvoxamine group compared to placebo (77/739 vs 108/733; Relative Risk [RR]: 0.71; 95% Bayesian Credible Interval [95% BCI]: 0.54 - 0.93), with a probability of superiority of 99.4% surpassing the prespecified superiority threshold of 97.6% (risk difference 4.3%). Of the composite primary outcome events, 88% were hospitalizations. Findings were similar for the mITT analysis (RR0.68, 95% BCI : 0.50- 0.91).

                "prompt": "Local measures enable COVID-19 containment with fewer restrictions due to cooperative effects\nBACKGROUND: Many countries worldwide are faced with the choice between the (re)surgence of COVID-19 and endangering the economic and mental well-being of their citizens. While infection numbers are monitored and measures adjusted, a systematic strategy for balancing contact restrictions and socioeconomic life in the absence of a vaccine is currently lacking. METHODS: In a mathematical model, we determine the efficacy of regional containment strategies, where contact restrictions are triggered locally in individual regions upon crossing critical infection number thresholds. Our stochastic meta-population model distinguishes between contacts within a region and cross-regional contacts. We use current data on the spread of COVID-19 in Germany, Italy, England, New York State and Florida, including the effects of their individual national lockdowns, and county population sizes obtained from census data to define individual regions. As a performance measure, we determine the number of days citizens will experience contact restrictions over the next 5 years (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153restriction time\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2) and compare it to an equivalent national lockdown strategy. To extract crucial parameters, we vary the proportion of cross-regional contacts (between 0% and 100%), the thresholds for initiating local measures (between 5 and 20 active infections per 100,000 inhabitants) as well as their duration after infection numbers have returned below the threshold (between 7 and 28 days). We compare performance across the five different countries and test how further subdivision of large counties into independently controlled regions of up to 100,000 or 200,000 inhabitants affects the results. FINDINGS: Our numerical simulations show a substantially reduced restriction time for regional containment, if the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 without restrictions, R(0), is only slightly larger than 1 and the proportion of cross-regional contacts (the so-called leakiness) is low. In Germany, specifically, for R(0)=1.14, a leakiness of 1% is sufficiently low to reduce the mean restriction time from 468 days (s.d. 3 days) for the national containment strategy to 43 days (s.d. 3 days across simulations) for the regional strategy, when local measures are initiated at 10 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 7 days. For R(0)=1.28, the allowed leakiness for minimal restriction time reduces to approximately 0.3%. The dependence of the restriction time on the leakiness is threshold-like only for regional containment, due to cooperative effects. It rises to levels similar to the national containment strategy for a leakiness > 10% (517 days national vs. 486 days regional for leakiness 32% and R(0)=1.14). We find a strong correlation between the population size of each region and the experienced restriction time. For countries with large counties, this can result in only a mild reduction in restriction time for regional containment, which can only be partly compensated by lower thresholds for initiating local measures and increasing their duration. In contrast, further subdividing large counties into smaller units can ensure a strong reduction of the restriction time for the regional strategy. INTERPRETATION: The leakiness, i.e. the proportion of cross-regional contacts, and the regional structure itself were crucial parameters for the performance of the regional strategy. Therefore, regional strategies could offer an adaptive way to contain the epidemic with fewer overall restrictions, if cross-regional infections can be kept below the critical level, which could be achieved without affecting local socioeconomic freedom. Maintaining general hygiene and contact tracing, testing should be intensified to ensure regional measures can be initiated at low infection thresholds, preventing the spread of the disease to other regions before local elimination. While such tight control could lead to more restrictions in the short run, restrictions necessary for long-term containment could be reduced by up to a factor of 10. Our open-source simulation code is freely available and can be readily adapted to other countries.

                "prompt": "COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical intervention portfolio effectiveness and risk communication predominance\nNon-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) including resource allocation, risk communication, social distancing and travel restriction, are mainstream actions to control the spreading of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide. Different countries implemented their own combinations of NPIs to prevent local epidemics and healthcare system overloaded. Portfolios, as temporal sets of NPIs have various systemic impacts on preventing cases in populations. Here, we developed a probabilistic modeling framework to evaluate the effectiveness of NPI portfolios at the macroscale. We employed a deconvolution method to back-calculate incidence of infections and estimate the effective reproduction number by using the package EpiEstim. We then evaluated the effectiveness of NPIs using ratios of the reproduction numbers and considered them individually and as a portfolio systemically. Based on estimates from Japan, we estimated time delays of symptomatic-to-confirmation and infection-to-confirmation as 7.4 and 11.4 days, respectively. These were used to correct surveillance data of other countries. Considering 50 countries, risk communication and returning to normal life were the most and least effective yielding the aggregated effectiveness of 0.11 and - 0.05 that correspond to a 22.4% and 12.2% reduction and increase in case growth. The latter is quantified by the change in reproduction number before and after intervention implementation. Countries with the optimal NPI portfolio are along an empirical Pareto frontier where mean and variance of effectiveness are maximized and minimized independently of incidence levels. Results indicate that implemented interventions, regardless of NPI portfolios, had distinct incidence reductions and a clear timing effect on infection dynamics measured by sequences of reproduction numbers. Overall, the successful suppression of the epidemic cannot work without the non-linear effect of NPI portfolios whose effectiveness optimality may relate to country-specific socio-environmental factors.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Since mobility graphs are naturally attributed, directed and become more and more disconnected as more and more non-pharmaceutical measures are implemented, we discarded spectral complexity measures and classical ones such as network efficiency.

Thus, effective public health interventions are urgently introduced. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively estimate the SARS-CoV-2 transmission probability and evaluate the influence of environmental parameters and individual intervention on the epidemic prevention. For this purpose, (1) we estimate the virus emission rate with Diamond Princess Cruise Ship infection data by Monte Carlo simulation and the improved Wells-Riley model, and (2) employ the reproductive number R to quantify diverse mitigation strategies. Different determinants are examined such as the duration of exposure, the number of passengers combined with individual interventions such as mask type and mask-wearing rate. The results show that the SARS-CoV-2 quantum generation rate is 185.63. The R shows a stronger positive correlation with the exposure time comparing to the number of passengers. In this light, reducing the frequency of long-distance journeys on crowded public transportation may be required to reduce the spread of the virus during the pandemic. N95 mask and surgical mask can reduce the transmission risk by 97 and 84%, respectively, and even homemade mask can reduce the risk by 67%, which indicates that it is necessary to advocate wearing masks on public transportation.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In the present study, we aimed to provide a statistical characterization of COVID-19 transmissions that led to this small outbreak. We collated the individual data of the first 28 confirmed cases reported from 20 January to 10 February 2020. We estimated key epidemiological parameters such as reporting delay (i.e., time from symptom onset to confirmation), incubation period, and serial interval by fitting probability distributions to the data based on the maximum likelihood estimation. We also estimated the basic reproduction number (R0) using the renewal equation, which allows for the transmissibility to differ between imported and locally transmitted cases. There were 16 imported and 12 locally transmitted cases, and secondary transmissions per case were higher for the imported cases than the locally transmitted cases (nine vs. three cases). The mean reporting delays were estimated to be 6.76 days (95% CI: 4.53, 9.28) and 2.57 days (95% CI: 1.57, 4.23) for imported and locally transmitted cases, respectively. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 5.53 days (95% CI: 3.98, 8.09) and was shorter than the mean serial interval of 6.45 days (95% CI: 4.32, 9.65). The R0 was estimated to be 0.40 (95% CI: 0.16, 0.99), accounting for the local and imported cases. The fewer secondary cases and shorter reporting delays for the locally transmitted cases suggest that contact tracing of imported cases was effective at reducing further transmissions, which helped to keep R0 below one and the overall transmissions small.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODOLOGY: The present study employs Monte Carlo based transmission growth simulations for Italy, Germany and Turkey. The probabilities of transmission at home, work and social networks and the number of initial cases have been calibrated to match the basic reproduction number and the reported fatality curves. Parametric studies were conducted to observe the effect of social distancing, work closure, testing and quarantine of the family and colleagues of positively tested individuals. RESULTS: It is observed that estimates of the number of initial cases in Italy compared to Turkey and Germany are higher. Turkey will probably experience about 30% less number of fatalities than Germany due its smaller elderly population. If social distancing and work contacts are limited to 25% of daily routines, Germany and Turkey may limit the number of fatalities to a few thousands as the reproduction number decreases to about 1.3 from 2.8. Random testing may reduce the number of fatalities by 10% upon testing least 5/1000 of the population. Quarantining of family and workmates of positively tested individuals may reduce the total number of fatalities by about 50%. CONCLUSIONS: The fatality rate of Covid-19 is estimated to be about 1.5% based on the simulation results. This may further be reduced by limiting the number of non-family contacts to two, conducting tests more than 0.5% of the population and immediate quarantine of the contacts for positively tested individuals.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We examined associations of stay-at-home order (SAHO) and face-masking recommendation with COVID-19 epidemics in the USA. Methods: In this quasi-experimental interrupted time-series study, we modeled temporal trends in daily new cases and deaths of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers in the USA between March 1 and April 20, 2020. In addition, we conducted simulation analyses. Results: The number of residents under SAHO increased since March 19 and plateaued at 290,829,980 (88.6% of the U.S. population) on April 7. Trends in COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers peaked on March 23, further reduced on April 3, and fell below/around 1.0 on April 13. Early-implementation and early-lift of SAHO would reduce and increase COVID-19 epidemics, respectively.

There were two turning points in daily new-case trend, being March 28 (slope-changes = -0.09) and April 3 (slope-changes = -0.09), which appeared to be associated with implementation of SAHO on March 28 (affecting 48.5% of the US population in 22 states and District of Columbia), and face-masking recommendation on April 3, respectively. There were also two turning points in daily new-death trend, being April 9 (slope-changes = -0.06) and April 19 (slope-changes = -0.90).

During it appears in China, Chinese government quickly put forward and implement prevention and control measures to keep its spread within limits. This study aims to investigate the impacts of the prevention and control measures in controlling COVID-19 epidemic in China, so as to give a clue to control its spread in the world. Methods: : We establish a two-stage dynamics transmission model with \"lockdown of Wuhan city\" as the time line. The first stage is the SEIR derived model that considers the contagious of the exposed. It simulates the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province before \"lockdown of Wuhan city\". The second stage is a novel transmission dynamics model named SEIRQH. It takes into account the influence on the COVID-19 epidemic from the series of measures such as travel restriction, contact tracing, centralized treatment, the asymptomatic infected patients, hospitalized patients and so on. It simulates the COVID-19 epidemic in China after \"lockdown of Wuhan city\". The least square method is used to estimate the parameters of SEIR derived model and the proposed SEIRQH model based on the collected epidemic data of COVID-19 from Hubei Province and the mainland of China. Results: : The SEIR derived model fits the actual data in Hubei province before \"lockdown of Wuhan city\". The basic reproduction number of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province is 3.2035 before \"lockdown of Wuhan city\". The SEIRQH model fits the number of the hospitalized persons of COVID-19 in Hubei Province and the mainland of China perfectly. The control reproductive number are 0.11428 and 0.09796 in Hubei Province and the mainland of China, respectively. The prevention and control measures taken by Chinese government play the significant role against the COVID-19 spread in China. Conclusions: : Our two-stage dynamics transmission model simulates the COVID-19 in China, especially our SEIRQH model fits the actual data very well.

As a result, age-stratified modeling for COVID-19 dynamics is the key to study how to reduce hospitalizations and mortality from COVID-19. By taking advantage of network theory, we develop an age-stratified epidemic model for COVID-19 in complex contact networks. Specifically, we present an extension of standard SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed) compart-mental model, called age-stratified SEAHIR (susceptible-exposed-asymptomatic-hospitalized-infectious-removed) model, to capture the spread of COVID-19 over multitype random networks with general degree distributions. We derive several key epidemiological metrics and then propose an age-stratified vaccination strategy to decrease the mortality and hospitalizations. Through extensive study, we discover that the outcome of vaccination prioritization depends on the reproduction number R0. Specifically, the elderly should be prioritized only when R0 is relatively high. If ongoing intervention policies, such as universal masking, could suppress R0 at a relatively low level, prioritizing the high-transmission age group (i.e., adults aged 20-39) is most effective to reduce both mortality and hospitalizations. These conclusions provide useful recommendations for age-based vaccination pri-oritization for COVID-19.

This was implemented by the temporary closing of many workplaces and people were required to follow social distancing. Networks are a great way to represent interactions among people and the temporary severing of these interactions. Here, we present a network model of human-human interactions that could be mediators of disease spread. The nodes of this network are individuals and different types of edges denote family cliques, workplace interactions, interactions arising from essential needs, and social interactions. Each individual can be in one of four states: susceptible, infected, immune, and dead. The network and the disease parameters are informed by the existing literature on Covid-19. Using this model, we simulate the spread of an infectious disease in the presence of various mitigation scenarios. For example, lockdown is implemented by deleting edges that denote non-essential interactions. We validate the simulation results with the real data by matching the basic and effective reproduction numbers during different phases of the spread. We also simulate different possibilities of the slow lifting of the lockdown by varying the transmission rate as facilities are slowly opened but people follow prevention measures like wearing masks etc. We make predictions on the probability and intensity of a second wave of infection in each of these scenarios.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Methods: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January and February 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. Findings: We estimated that the median daily reproduction number, Rt , declined from 2.35 (95% CI: 1.15-4.77) one week before travel restrictions were introduced on 23rd January to 1.05 (95% CI: 0.413-2.39) one week after. Based on our estimates of Rt,we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential as Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. Interpretation: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission likely declined in Wuhan during late January 2020, coinciding with the introduction of control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan pre-control, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but may still cause new outbreaks eventually.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This may have been attributable to the spread of the Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant. This paper documents real-time analysis that aimed to investigate the association between changes in the proportion of positive cases that were S-gene positive, an indicator of the Delta variant against a background of the previously predominant Alpha variant, and the estimated time-varying Rt at the level of upper-tier local authorities (UTLA). Method: We explored the relationship between the proportion of samples that were S-gene positive and the Rt of test-positive cases over time from the 23 February 2021 to the 25 May 2021. Effective reproduction numbers were estimated using the EpiNow2 R package independently for each local authority using two different estimates of the generation time. We then fit a range of regression models to estimate a multiplicative relationship between S-gene positivity and weekly mean Rt estimate. Results: We found evidence of an association between increased mean Rt estimates and the proportion of S-gene positives across all models evaluated with the magnitude of the effect increasing as model flexibility was decreased. Models that adjusted for either national level or NHS region level time-varying residuals were found to fit the data better, suggesting potential unexplained confounding. Conclusions: Our results indicated that even after adjusting for time-varying residuals between NHS regions, S-gene positivity was associated with an increase in the effective reproduction number of COVID-19. These findings were robust across a range of models and generation time assumptions, though the specific effect size was variable depending on the assumptions used. The lower bound of the estimated effect indicated that the reproduction number of Delta was above 1 in almost all local authorities throughout the period of investigation.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

One way to model such a system, in order to improve preparedness, and learn more about how an infectious disease, such as COVID-19, might spread through a population, is agent-based epidemiological modelling. When a pandemic is caused by an emerging disease, it takes time to develop a completely new model that captures the complexity of the system. In this paper, we discuss adapting an existing agent-based model for the spread of measles in Ireland to simulate the spread of COVID-19. The model already captures the population structure and commuting patterns of the Irish population, and therefore, once adapted to COVID-19, it can provide important insight on the pandemic, specifically in Ireland. We first investigate the different disease parameters that need to be adjusted to simulate the spread of COVID-19 instead of measles and then run a set of experiments initially comparing the model output for our original measles model with that from the adjusted COVID-19 model. We then report on experiments on how the different values of the basic reproductive number, R0, influence the simulated outbreaks, and find that our model behaves as expected: the higher the R0, the more agents are infected. Then, we demonstrate how different intervention strategies, such as vaccinations and school closures, influence the spread of measles and COVID-19 and how we can simulate real pandemic timings and interventions in our model. We show that with the same society, environment and transportation components among the different disease components lead to very different results for the two diseases, and that our COVID-19 model, when run for Leitrim County, Ireland, predicts a similar outbreak length to a real outbreak in Leitrim County, Ireland, but the model results in a higher number of infected agents compared to the real outbreak. This difference in cases is most likely due to identifying all cases of COVID-19 in the model opposed to only those tested. Once an agent-based model is created to simulate a specific complex system or society, the disease component can be adapted to simulate different infectious disease outbreaks. This makes agent-based models a powerful tool that can be used to help understand the spread of new and emerging infectious diseases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

To examine spatiotemporal changes in the transmission potential, we aimed to present regional estimates of the doubling time and reproduction number (Rt) for COVID-19 in the country. METHODS: Daily series of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the most affected regions were extracted from publicly available sources. We employed established mathematical and statistical methods to investigate the time-varying reproduction numbers and doubling time for COVID-19 in Korea. RESULTS: At the regional level, Seoul and Gyeonggi Province experienced the first peak of COVID-19 in early March, followed by a second wave in early June, withRt exceeding 3.0 and mean doubling time ranging from 3.6 to 10.1 days. As of 19 July, 2020, Gyeongbuk Province and Daegu had yet to experience a second wave of the disease. During the first wave, mean Rt for these areas reached 3.5-4.4, and doubling time ranged from 2.8 to 4.6 days.

This raised the question: is mass quarantine and isolation effective as a social tool in addition to its scientific use as a medical tool? In an effort to address this question, using a epidemiological model driven approach augmented by machine learning, we show that the quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan brought down the effective reproduction number R(t) of the CoVID-19 spread from R(t)>1 to R(t)<1 within a month after the imposition of quarantine control measures in Wuhan, China. This ultimately resulted in a stagnation phase in the infected case count in Wuhan. Our results indicate that the strict public health policies implemented in Wuhan may have played a crucial role in halting down the spread of infection and such measures should potentially be implemented in other highly affected countries such as South Korea, Italy and Iran to curtail spread of the disease. Finally, our forecasting results predict a stagnation in the quarantine control measures implemented in Wuhan towards the end of March 2020; this would lead to a subsequent stagnation in the effective reproduction number at R(t)<1. We warn that immediate relaxation of the quarantine measures in Wuhan may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t)>1. Thus, it may be wise to relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the quarantined/isolated individuals are recovered.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Here, based on the publicly available epidemiological data for Hubei, China from January 11 to February 10, 2020, we provide estimates of the main epidemiological parameters. In particular, we provide an estimation of the case fatality and case recovery ratios, along with their 90% confidence intervals as the outbreak evolves. On the basis of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Dead (SIDR) model, we provide estimations of the basic reproduction number (R0), and the per day infection mortality and recovery rates. By calibrating the parameters of the SIRD model to the reported data, we also attempt to forecast the evolution of the of the outbreak at the epicenter three weeks ahead, i.e. until February 29. As the number of infected individuals, especially of those with asymptomatic or mild courses, is suspected to be much higher than the official numbers, which can be considered only as a subset of the actual numbers of infected and recovered cases in the total population, we have repeated the calculations under a second scenario that considers twenty times the number of confirmed infected cases and forty times the number of recovered, leaving the number of deaths unchanged. Based on the reported data, the expected value of R0 as computed considering the period from the 11th of January until the 18th of January, using the official counts of confirmed cases was found to be ~4.6, while the one computed under the second scenario was found to be ~3.2. Thus, based on the SIRD simulations, the estimated average value of R0 was found to be ~2.6 based on confirmed cases and ~2 based on the second scenario. Our forecasting flashes a note of caution for the presently unfolding outbreak in China. Based on the official counts for confirmed cases, the simulations suggest that the cumulative number of infected could reach 180,000 (with lower bound of 45,000) by February 29. Regarding the number of deaths, simulations forecast that on the basis of the up to the 10th of February reported data, the death toll might exceed 2,700 (as a lower bound) by February 29. Our analysis further reveals a significant decline of the case fatality ratio from January 26 to which various factors may have contributed, such as the severe control measures taken in Hubei, China (e.g. quarantine and hospitalization of infected individuals), but mainly because of the fact that the actual cumulative numbers of infected and recovered cases in the population most likely are much higher than the reported ones. Thus, in a scenario where we have taken twenty times the confirmed number of infected and forty times the confirmed number of recovered cases, the case fatality ratio is around 0.15% in the total population. Importantly, based on this scenario, simulations suggest a slow down of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Our objective was to model the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak progression in Italian regions vs. Lombardy to assess the epidemic's progression. Our setting was Italy, and especially Lombardy, which is experiencing a heavy burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections. The peak of new daily cases of the epidemic has been reached on the 29th, while was delayed in Central and Southern Italian regions compared to Northern ones. In our models, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection, both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period and also by using day-by-day assessments based on single observations. We used the susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading of the pandemic in Italy. The two methods provide an agreement of values, although the first method based on exponential fit should provide a better estimation, being computed on the entire time series. Taking into account the growth rate of the infection across a 1-month period, each infected person in Lombardy has involved 4 other people (3.6 based on data of April 23rd) compared to a value of R0 = 2.68, as reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan. According to our model, Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany and Marche will reach an R0 value of up to 3.5. The R0 was 3.11 for Lazio and 3.14 for the Campania region, where the latter showed the highest value among the Southern Italian regions, followed by Apulia (3.11), Sicily (2.99), Abruzzo (3.0), Calabria (2.84), Basilicata (2.66), and Molise (2.6). The R0 value is decreased in Lombardy and the Northern regions, while it is increased in Central and Southern regions. The expected peak of the SEIR model is set at the end of March, at a national level, with Southern Italian regions reaching the peak in the first days of April. Regarding the strengths and limitations of this study, our model is based on assumptions that might not exactly correspond to the evolution of the epidemic. What we know about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is based on Chinese data that seems to be different than those from Italy; Lombardy is experiencing an evolution of the epidemic that seems unique inside Italy and Europe, probably due to demographic and environmental factors.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. METHODS: The infection was diagnosed in 136 individuals, and typing was confirmed by PCR and direct sequencing. The epidemiologic characteristics of the disease including the infection rate, incubation period, and basic reproductive number (R(0)), ie, number of cases directly infected by an infectious patient during the course of the disease, were investigated. The effectiveness of compartmentalization for infection control was determined by simulating the outbreak using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model. RESULTS: The majority of the HAdV-54-infected individuals were the children of 3 nursery schools (A, B, and C) and their parents on Oki Island. The infection rates in the 3 schools were 13.2%, 16.9%, and 17.2%, respectively. The one class of school B without the index case was initially compartmentalized, and the infection rate in this compartment was 0%. The incubation period was calculated to be 9.3 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 3.5 days, and the disease duration, 13.0 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 5.4 days. The R(0) was 1.43. Using these parameters, a SEIR model was constructed. The SEIR model well predicted the daily incidence of infection and indicated that the compartmentalization method provides effective reduction in the incidence of the infection, with much earlier control. CONCLUSIONS: The compartmentalization method is effective to control HAdV-54 outbreaks.

Assessing this risk implies quantifying transmission from humans-to-cats, from cats-to-cats and from cats-to-humans. Here we quantified the risk of cat-to-cat transmission by reviewing published literature describing transmission either experimentally or under natural conditions in infected households. Data from these studies were collated to quantify the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number R0 among cats. The estimated R0 was significantly higher than 1, hence cats could play a role in the transmission and maintenance of SARS-CoV-2. Questions that remain to be addressed are the risk of transmission from humans-to-cats and cats-to-humans. Further data on household transmission and data on virus levels in both the environment around infected cats and their exhaled air could be a step towards assessing these risks.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The lack of an established vaccine for this disease has caused millions of illnesses and hundreds of thousands of deaths globally. Mathematical models have become crucial tools in determining the potential and seriousness of the disease and in helping the types of strategic intervention measures to be taken to prevent and control the intensity of the spread of the disease. In this study, a compartmental epidemic model of COVID-19 is proposed and analyzed to predict the transmission dynamics of the disease in Ethiopia. Analytically, the basic reproduction number is determined. To observe the dynamics of the system, a detailed stability analysis of the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) of the proposed model is carried out. Our result shows that the DFE is stable if the basic reproduction number is less than unity and unstable otherwise. Also, the parameters of the assumed model are estimated using the actual data of COVID-19 from Ethiopia reported for three months between March and June 2020. Furthermore, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive number and found that reducing the rate of transmission is the most important factor in achieving disease control. Numerical simulations demonstrate the suitability of the proposed model for the actual COVID-19 data in Ethiopia. In particular, the numerical simulation shows an increase in the rate of transmission leads to a significant increase in the infected individuals. Thus, results of the numerical simulations are in agreement with the sensitivity results of the system. The possible implication of this is that declining the rate of transmission to the desired level could enable us to combat the disease. Numerical simulations are also performed to forecast the disease prevalence in the community.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

A common question is if and when a country or region will reach herd immunity $h$. The classical herd immunity level $h_C$ is defined as $h_C=1-1/R_0$, where $R_0$ is the basic reproduction number, for covid-19 estimated to lie somewhere in the range 2.2-3.5 depending on country and region. It is shown here that the disease-induced herd immunity level $h_D$, after an outbreak has taken place in a country/region with a set of preventive measures put in place, is actually substantially smaller than $h_C$. As an illustration we show that if $R_0=2.5$ in an age-structured community with mixing rates fitted to social activity studies, and also categorizing individuals into three categories: low active, average active and high active, and where preventive measures affect all mixing rates proportionally, then the disease-induced herd immunity level is $h_D=43\\%$ rather than $h_C=1-1/2.5=60\\%$. Consequently, a lower fraction infected is required for herd immunity to appear. The underlying reason is that when immunity is induced by disease spreading, the proportion infected in groups with high contact rates is greater than that in groups with low contact rates. Consequently, disease-induced immunity is stronger than when immunity is uniformly distributed in the community as in the classical herd immunity level.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods We searched Pubmed, European PMC, Medline and Embase for case series and cohort studies published between 1st January 2020 and 21st May 2021 which included all CYP admitted to hospital with \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a5 30 CYP with SARS-CoV-2 or \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a5 5 CYP with PIMS-TS or MIS-C. Eligible studies contained (1) details of age, sex, ethnicity or co-morbidities, and (2) an outcome which included admission to critical care, mechanical invasive ventilation, cardiovascular support, or death. Studies reporting outcomes in more restricted groupings of co-morbidities were eligible for narrative review. We used random effects meta-analyses for aggregate study-level data and multilevel mixed effect models for IPD data to examine risk factors (age, sex, comorbidities) associated with admission to critical care and death. Data shown are odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI). PROSPERO: CRD42021235338 Findings 83 studies were included, 57 (21,549 patients) in the meta-analysis (of which 22 provided IPD) and 26 in the narrative synthesis. Most studies had an element of bias in their design or reporting. Sex was not associated with critical care or death. Compared with CYP aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 years (reference group), infants (aged <1 year) had increased odds of admission to critical care (OR 1.63 (95% CI 1.40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.90)) and death (OR 2.08 (1.57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.86)).

The number of comorbid conditions was associated with increased odds of admission to critical care and death for COVID-19 in a step-wise fashion. Compared with CYP without comorbidity, odds ratios for critical care admission were: 1.49 (1.45\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.53) for 1 comorbidity; 2.58 (2.41\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.75) for 2 comorbidities; 2.97 (2.04\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.32) for \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a53 comorbidities.

Neurological and cardiac comorbidities were associated with the greatest increase in odds of severe disease or death. Obesity increased the odds of severe disease and death independently of other comorbidities. IPD analysis demonstrated that, compared to children without co-morbidity, the risk difference of admission to critical care was increased in those with 1 comorbidity by 3.61% (1.87\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01535.36); 2 comorbidities by 9.26% (4.87\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015313.65); \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a53 comorbidities 10.83% (4.39\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317.28), and for death: 1 comorbidity 1.50% (0.00\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.10); 2 comorbidities 4.40% (-0.10\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01538.80) and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a53 co-morbidities 4.70 (0.50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01538.90). Interpretation Hospitalised CYP at greatest vulnerability of severe disease or death with SARS-CoV-2 infection are infants, teenagers, those with cardiac or neurological conditions, or 2 or more comorbid conditions, and those who are obese. These groups should be considered higher priority for vaccination and for protective shielding when appropriate. Whilst odds ratios were high, the absolute increase in risk for most comorbidities was small compared to children without underlying conditions.

In this paper, we focus on studying the basic reproduction number (R(0)) for two important variants of COVID-19 pandemic in Iran: Alpha and Delta variants. We use four different methods, three statistical models and one mathematical model, to compute R(0): Exponential Growth Rate (EGR), Maximum Likelihood (ML), Sequential Bayesian (SB), and time-dependent SIR model. Alpha variant of COVID-19 was active in Iran from March 10, 2021 until June 10, 2021. Our computations indicate that total R(0) of this variant according to EGR, ML, SB, and SIR model is respectively 0.9999 (95% CI: 0.9994-1), 1.046 (95% CI: 1.044-1.049), 1.06 (95% CI: 1.03-1.08), and 2.79 (95% CI: 2.77-2.81) in the whole active time interval. Moreover, during the time interval from April 3, 2021 to April 9, 2021 in which this variant was in its exponential growth in Iran, R(0) of Alpha variant in Iran according to SB, EGR, ML, and SIR model is respectively 2.26 (95% CI: 2.04-2.49), 2.64 (95% CI: 2.58-2.7), 11.38 (95% CI: 11.28-11.48), and 12.13 (95% CI: 12.12-12.14). Delta variant was active in Iran during the time interval from June 22, 2021 until September 22, 2021. Our computations show that during the time interval from July 3, 2021 to July 8, 2021 in which this variant was in its exponential growth in Iran, R(0) of Delta variant in Iran according to SB, EGR, ML, and SIR model is respectively 3 (95% CI: 2.34-3.66), 3.1 (95% CI: 3.02-3.17), 12 (95% CI: 11.89-12.12), and 23.3 (95% CI: 23.19-23.41). Further, total R(0) of Delta variant in Iran in the whole active time interval according to EGR, ML, SB, and SIR model is respectively 1.042 (95% CI: 1.04-1.043), 1.053 (95% CI: 1.051-1.055), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.63-0.95), and 5.65 (95% CI: 5.6-5.7).

Although there are anecdotal reports that methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clones vary in their transmissibility in hospital settings, attempts to quantify such variation are lacking for common subtypes, as are methods for addressing this question using routinely-collected MRSA screening data in endemic settings. Here we present a method to quantify the time-varying transmissibility of different subtypes of common bacterial nosocomial pathogens using routine surveillance data. The method adapts approaches for estimating reproduction numbers based on the probabilistic reconstruction of epidemic trees, but uses relative hazards rather than serial intervals to assign probabilities to different sources for observed transmission events. The method is applied to data collected as part of a retrospective observational study of a concurrent MRSA outbreak in the United Kingdom with dominant endemic MRSA clones (ST22 and ST36) and an Asian ST239 MRSA strain (ST239-TW) in two linked adult intensive care units, and compared with an approach based on a fully parametric transmission model. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the clones responded differently to an infection control measure based on the use of topical antiseptics, which was more effective at reducing transmission of endemic clones. They also suggest that in one of the two ICUs patients colonized or infected with the ST239-TW MRSA clone had consistently higher risks of transmitting MRSA to patients free of MRSA. These findings represent some of the first quantitative evidence of enhanced transmissibility of a pandemic MRSA lineage, and highlight the potential value of tailoring hospital infection control measures to specific pathogen subtypes.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In December 2020, variants with different characteristics that could affect transmissibility emerged around the world. To address this new dynamic of the disease, we formulate and analyze a mathematical model of a two-strain COVID- 19 transmission dynamics with strain 1 vaccination. The model is theoretically analyzed and sufficient conditions for the stability of its equilibria are derived. In addition to the disease-free and endemic equilibria, the model also has single-strain 1 and strain 2 endemic equilibria. Using the center manifold theory, it is shown that the model does not exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, and global stability of the model equilibria when the basic reproduction number R 0 is either less or greater than unity as the case maybe are proved using various approaches. Simulations to support the model theoretical results are provided. We calculate the basic reproductive number for both strains R 1 and R 2 independently. Results indicate that - both strains will persist when R 1 > 1 and R 2 > 1 - Stain 2 could establish itself as the dominant strain if R 1 < 1 and R 2 > 1, or when R 2 is at least two times greater than R 1 . However, with the current knowledge of the epidemiology of the COVID-19 pandemic and the availability of treatment and an effective vaccine against strain 1, it is expected that eventually, strain 2 will likely be eradicated in the population due to de novo herd immunity provided the threshold parameter R 2 is controlled to remain below unity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The stochastic part of the framework is based on Bayesian inference. The model is informed by the actual COVID-19 data and the current epidemiological findings about the disease. The framework combines many available data sources (number of positive cases, number of patients in hospitals and in intensive care, etc.) to make outputs as accurate as possible and incorporates the times of non-pharmaceutical governmental interventions which were adopted worldwide to slow-down the pandemic. The model estimates the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, the number of infected individuals and the number of patients in different disease progression states in time. It can be used for estimating current infection fatality rate, proportion of individuals not detected and short term forecasting of important indicators for monitoring the state of the healthcare system. With the prediction of the number of patients in hospitals and intensive care units, policy makers could make data driven decisions to potentially avoid overloading the capacities of the healthcare system. The model is applied to Slovene COVID-19 data showing the effectiveness of the adopted interventions for controlling the epidemic by reducing the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. It is estimated that the proportion of infected people in Slovenia was among the lowest in Europe (0.350%, 90% CI [0.245-0.573]%), that infection fatality rate in Slovenia until the end of first wave was 1.56% (90% CI [0.94-2.21]%) and the proportion of unidentified cases was 88% (90% CI [83-93]%).

Analytical results are obtained using the respective ratios of susceptible, exposed (incubating), and asymptomatic classes to the clinical symptomatic infective class. Conditions are given for bistability of equilibria to occur, where trajectories with distinct initial values could result in either a major outbreak where the disease spreads to the whole population or a lesser outbreak where some members of the population remain uninfected. This dynamic behavior did not arise in a SARS model without asymptomatic infective class studied by Hsu and Hsieh (SIAM J. Appl.

Hence, this illustrates that depending on the initial states, control of a disease outbreak with asymptomatic infections may involve more than simply reducing the reproduction number. Moreover, the presence of asymptomatic infections could result in either a positive or negative impact on the outbreak, depending on different sets of conditions on the parameters, as illustrated with numerical simulations.

At the time of writing, Northwest Syria (NWS) was outside governmental control and faced the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak. Since the emergence of this disease, several studies have looked at the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission, predicted its progression, and determined the impact of different preventive measures. While most of these studies' settings were in stable contexts, this study investigated the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Northwest Syria, a conflict-affected region, for nine months (from July 2020 to March 2021) using the Suspected-Infected-Removed (SIR) model. We adjusted the SIR model to study the impact of wearing facial masks on the outbreak dynamics and progression. Based on available data and using the basic and adjusted SIR models, we estimated the value of the basic reproduction number (R0), which provides an initial prediction of disease progression. Using the basic SIR model, the estimated R0 for the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 in Northwest Syria was 2.38. The resulting figures were overestimated in comparison with the reported numbers and data on the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the results were significantly reasonable when we adjusted the model for a preventive measure (in this case, wearing face masks). Face masks, the most available preventive measure to be applied in emergency and conflict settings, remarkably affect the outbreak dynamics and may play a key role in controlling and limiting the spread of COVID-19. The novelty of the study is provided by simulating the progress of the COVID-19 outbreak in conflict settings, as it is the first study to predict the dynamics of COVID-19 disease in NWS by adjusting for face-mask-wearing as a preventive measure to explore its impact on outbreak dynamics.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R(0), across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.18-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.9 days). We found that for such rapid epidemic growth, high levels of intervention efforts are necessary, no matter the goal is mitigation or containment. We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R(0) value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries.

The real-time assessment of community transmission study (REACT-1) obtains throat and nose swabs from randomly selected people in England in order to describe patterns of SARS-CoV-2 prevalence. Here, we report data from round 9a of REACT-1 for swabs collected between 4th and 13th February 2021. Results : Out of 85,473 tested-swabs, 378 were positive. Overall weighted prevalence of infection in the community in England was 0.51%, a fall of more than two thirds since our last report (round 8) in January 2021 when 1.57% of people tested positive. We estimate a halving time of 14.6 days and a reproduction number R of 0.72, based on the difference in prevalence between the end of round 8 and the beginning of round 9. Although prevalence fell in all nine regions of England over the same period, there was greater uncertainty in the trend for North West, North East, and Yorkshire and The Humber. Prevalence fell substantially across all age groups with highest prevalence among 18- to 24-year olds at 0.89% (0.47%, 1.67%) and those aged 5 to12 years at 0.86% (0.60%, 1.24%). Large household size, living in a deprived neighbourhood, and Asian ethnicity were all associated with increased prevalence. Healthcare and care home workers were more likely to test positive compared to other workers. Conclusions : There is a strong decline in prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in England among the general population five to six weeks into lockdown, but prevalence remains high: at levels similar to those observed in late September 2020. Also, the number of COVID-19 cases in hospitals is higher than at the peak of the first wave in April 2020. The effects of easing of social distancing when we transition out of lockdown need to be closely monitored to avoid a resurgence in infections and renewed pressure on health services.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

For this purpose, the epidemiologists are also augmenting their contribution in structuring such models that could depict a scheme to diminish the basic reproduction number.

The aim is to illustrate the memory effect on the dynamics of COVID'19 with and without prevention measures through fractional calculus. Therefore, the structure of the model is in line with generalized proportional fractional derivative to assess the effects at each chronological change. Awareness about using medical mask, social distancing, frequent use of sanitizer or cleaning hand and supportive care during treatment are the strategies followed worldwide in this fight. Taking these into consideration, the optimal objective function proposed for the surveillance mitigation of COVID'19, is contemplated as the cost function.

While the majority (about 65%) of the German population were fully vaccinated, incidence started growing exponentially in October 2021 with about 41% of recorded new cases aged twelve or above being symptomatic breakthrough infections, presumably also contributing to the dynamics. At the time, it (i) remains elusive how significant this contribution is and (ii) whether targeted non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) may stop the amplification of the ongoing crisis. Here, we estimate that about 67%-76% of all new infections are caused by unvaccinated individuals, implying that only 24%-33% are caused by the vaccinated. Furthermore, we estimate 38%-51% of new infections to be caused by unvaccinated individuals infecting other unvaccinated individuals. In total, unvaccinated individuals are expected to be involved in 8-9 of 10 new infections. We further show that decreasing the transmissibility of the unvaccinated by, e.g. targeted NPIs, causes a steeper decrease in the effective reproduction number R than decreasing the transmissibility of vaccinated individuals, potentially leading to temporary epidemic control. Furthermore, reducing contacts between vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals serves to decrease R in a similar manner as increasing vaccine uptake. Taken together, our results contribute to the public discourse regarding policy changes in pandemic response and highlight the importance of combined measures, such as vaccination campaigns and contact reduction, to achieve epidemic control and preventing an overload of public health\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Did the Tokyo Olympic Games enhance the transmission of COVID-19? An interpretation with machine learning\nBACKGROUND: In the summer of 2021, the Olympic Games were held in Tokyo during the state of emergency due to the spread of COVID-19 pandemic. New daily positive cases (DPC) increased before the Olympic Games, and then decreased a few weeks after the Games. However, several cofactors influencing DPC exist; consequently, careful consideration is needed for future international events during an epidemic. METHODS: The impact of the Olympic Games on new DPC were evaluated in the Tokyo, Osaka, and Aichi Prefectures using a well-trained and -evaluated long short-term memory (LSTM) network. In addition, we proposed a compensation method based on effective reproduction number (ERN) to assess the effect of the national holidays on the DPC. RESULTS: During the spread phase, the estimated DPC with LSTM was 30%\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015360% lower than that of the observed value, but was consistent with the compensated value of the ERN for the three prefectures. During the decay phase, the estimated DPC was consistent with the observed values. The timing of the decay coincided with achievement of a fully-vaccinated rate of 10%\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015315% of people aged <65 years. CONCLUSIONS: The up- and downsurge of the pandemic wave observed in July and September are likely attributable to high ERN during national holiday periods and to the vaccination effect, especially for people aged <65 years. The effect of national holidays in Tokyo was rather notable in Aichi and Osaka, which are distant from Tokyo. The effect of the Olympic Games on the spread and decay of the pandemic wave is neither dominant nor negligible due to the shifting of the national holiday dates to coincide with the Olympic Games.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: In 2020, the team developed a computational model of the U.S. simulating the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus and vaccination. RESULTS: Simulation experiments revealed that to prevent an epidemic (reduce the peak by >99%), the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when vaccination coverage is 100% (reproduction number=2.5-3.5). This vaccine efficacy threshold rises to 70% when coverage drops to 75% and up to 80% when coverage drops to 60% when reproduction number is 2.5, rising to 80% when coverage drops to 75% when the reproduction number is 3.5. To extinguish an ongoing epidemic, the vaccine efficacy has to be at least 60% when coverage is 100% and at least 80% when coverage drops to 75% to reduce the peak by 85%-86%, 61%-62%, and 32% when vaccination occurs after 5%, 15%, and 30% of the population, respectively, have already been exposed to COVID-19 coronavirus. A vaccine with an efficacy between 60% and 80% could still obviate the need for other measures under certain circumstances such as much higher, and in some cases, potentially unachievable, vaccination coverages. CONCLUSIONS: This study found that the vaccine has to have an efficacy of at least 70% to prevent an epidemic and of at least 80% to largely extinguish an epidemic without any other measures (e.g., social distancing).\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Random Sampling of Asymptomatic Hospital Employees: A Period Prevalence Study\nBACKGROUND: Novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a significant impact on the work force in hospital settings. Despite rigorous screening practices implemented at many institutions, reports have documented transmission from asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals in community environments. Evidence of nosocomial transmission between healthcare workers and patients in the early phase of the pandemic has further compounded the fears of safety in the workplace. We sought to determine the asymptomatic carriage rate of employees to inform messaging and response in the context of universal masking and eye protection. METHODS: We conducted a period prevalence study in asymptomatic hospital employees at a quaternary pediatric hospital during April to June 2020. Eligible employees included clinical staff, administrative staff, food services workers, and environmental services workers who had passed the temperature and symptom screening evaluation on entry to the campus. Samples were obtained from both nares of consenting individuals and ran daily on a validated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) platform. RESULTS: A total of 1394 employees consented to participate by June 15, 2020 and none of them had a positive result for COVID-19. Thus, the prevalence rate among asymptomatic employees was zero during this period (95%CI 0%-0.26%). Thirteen employees developed symptoms after initial enrollment and testing of which 1 tested positive for COVID-19. Based on these data, we estimate a monthly incidence rate of 0.8 new COVID-19 cases per 1000 asymptomatic employees (95%CI 0.2 - 4.4 per 1000). Of note, at the time of submission the R(0) for our region was 1.4, and the prevalence of COVID-19 infection among symptomatic employees was 9.9% (68/686 tested in our system, 95%CI: 7.8%-12.3%). CONCLUSION: We did not identify any COVID-19-positive asymptomatic hospital employees who passed screening measures. This suggests very low risk of nosocomial transmission to other employees, patients, and families. Along with low community prevalence and capture of COVID-19-positive symptomatic employees, we could confidently advise staff that universal surgical masking and eye protection were likely adequate to prevent significant exposure.

Some of these new variants have been of health public concern due to their higher infectiousness. We propose a theoretical mathematical model based on differential equations to study the effect of introducing a new, more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant in a population. The mathematical model is formulated in such a way that it takes into account the higher transmission rate of the new SARS-CoV-2 strain and the subpopulation of asymptomatic carriers. We find the basic reproduction number R0 using the method of the next generation matrix. This threshold parameter is crucial since it indicates what parameters play an important role in the outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic. We study the local stability of the infection-free and endemic equilibrium states, which are potential outcomes of a pandemic. Moreover, by using a suitable Lyapunov functional and the LaSalle invariant principle, it is proved that if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, the infection-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. Our study shows that the new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant will prevail and the prevalence of the preexistent variant would decrease and eventually disappear. We perform numerical simulations to support the analytic results and to show some effects of a new more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variant in a population.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

After nearly two months, the curve was succesfully flattened and social restrictions were gradually released. Unfortunately, pharmaceutical interventions are not yet available so it is expected that preventing COVID-19 outbreaks will depend mostly on the successful implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions, hence the need for well-informed models. In this study, we built a deterministic, continuous-time, age-stratified-SEIRD model with detailed hospital dynamics. Because the hospitalization data for Belgium have not been made public yet by the Belgian scientific institute of public health, we computed the hospitalization parameters based on data from 370 patients in two Ghent (Belgium) hospitals. The basic reproduction number during March 2020 was estimated as R0 = 2.83 and the model fits the hospitalization and ICU admission incidence under lockdown measures well. In spite of the release of social restrictions, hospitalizations have been steadily declining. We recomputed the basic reproduction number under lockdown release and found that it had to be as low as R0 = 0.73 to explain the endemic trend under the observed community mobility data. We further found that although the basic reproduction number in the population older than 70 years was smaller than one, this group compromises nearly half of the expected hospitalizations. This indicates that protection of the elderly may be the most efficient way to reduce strain on the public health care system in case of another SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In the absence of preventive medicine or a ready to use vaccine, mathematical models can provide useful scientific insights about transmission patterns and targets for drug development. In this study, we propose a within-host mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 infection considering innate and adaptive immune responses. We analyze the equilibrium points of the proposed model and obtain an expression of the basic reproduction number. We then numerically show the existence of a transcritical bifurcation. The proposed model is calibrated to real viral load data of two COVID-19 patients. Using the estimated parameters, we perform global sensitivity analysis with respect to the peak of viral load. Finally, we study the efficacy of antiviral drugs and vaccination on the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that blocking the production of the virus by infected cells decreases the viral load more than reducing the infection rate of healthy cells. Vaccination is also found useful but during the vaccine development phase, blocking virus production from infected cells can be targeted for antiviral drug development.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

At this point, it is desirable to monitor the degree to which political measures or social affairs have exerted influence on the spread of disease; however, tracing back individual transmission of infections whose incubation periods are long and highly variable seems to be difficult. Nevertheless, it may be possible to estimate the changes that may have occurred in the past, if we can suitably fit a proper model to daily event-occurrences. We have devised a state-space method for fitting the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases. This method detects changes occurring in the spread of the contagion in each country. Furthermore, this method can assess the impact of social events in terms of the temporally varying reproduction number representing the average number of cases directly caused by a single infected case. This information might serve as a reference for the behavioral guidelines that should be adopted according to the varying risk of infection.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods: We used the daily incidence cases of COVID-19, hospitalized due to a probable diagnosis of COVID-19 from 19 February 2020 to 17 November 2020 in Iran. Four models, including maximum likelihood (ML), exponential growth (EG), time-dependent (TD), sequential Bayesian (SB) were evaluated. The weekly reproduction number with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated. Results: TD model shows the best fit compared to other models for estimating reproduction number in Iran. The R0 in Iran in the first week of the epidemic, leading up to 21 February 2020 was 7.19, 95% CI: 5.56, 9.00. The lowest value for the Rt was equal to 0.77 between 3 to 10 March 2020 and 4 to 11 December 2020.

We examined the impact of these tiered restrictions, and alternatives for lockdown stringency, timing, and duration, on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission and hospital admissions and deaths from COVID-19. METHODS: We fit an age-structured mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to data on hospital admissions and hospital bed occupancy (ISARIC4C/COVID-19 Clinical Information Network, National Health Service [NHS] England), seroprevalence (Office for National Statistics, UK Biobank, REACT-2 study), virology (REACT-1 study), and deaths (Public Health England) across the seven NHS England regions from March 1, to Oct 13, 2020. We analysed mobility (Google Community Mobility) and social contact (CoMix study) data to estimate the effect of tiered restrictions implemented in England, and of lockdowns implemented in Northern Ireland and Wales, in October, 2020, and projected epidemiological scenarios for England up to March 31, 2021.

Closing schools was projected to further reduce hospital admissions to 157 000 (152 000\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153163 000) and deaths to 30 300 (29 000\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015331 900). A projected lockdown of greater than 4 weeks would reduce deaths but would bring diminishing returns in reducing peak pressure on hospital services. An earlier lockdown would have reduced deaths and hospitalisations in the short term, but would lead to a faster resurgence in cases after January, 2021. In a post-hoc analysis, we estimated that the second lockdown in England (Nov 5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dec 2) reduced R(t) by 22% (95% CrI 15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329), rather than the 32% (25\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339) reduction estimated for a Wales-stringency lockdown with schools open. INTERPRETATION: Lockdown measures outperform less stringent restrictions in reducing cumulative deaths. We projected that the lockdown policy announced to commence in England on Nov 5, with a similar stringency to the lockdown adopted in Wales, would reduce pressure on the health service and would be well timed to suppress deaths over the winter period, while allowing schools to remain open. Following completion of the analysis, we analysed new data from November, 2020, and found that despite similarities in policy, the second lockdown in England had a smaller impact on behaviour than did the second lockdown in Wales, resulting in more deaths and hospitalisations than we originally projected when focusing on a Wales-stringency scenario for the lockdown.

In the absence of any vaccine, various mitigation measures were used. In the past, the effect of temperature and humidity on the spread of the virus was studied for a very early phase of the data with mixed results. We are studying the impact of COVID-19 on the maximum temperature and relative humidity of a place using Indian states as test cases for SIR, SIRD, and SEIR models. We used a linear regression method to look for any dependency between effective reproduction number with maximum temperature and relative humidity. Most of the states show a correlation with the negative slope between the effective reproduction number with the maximum temperature and the relative humidity. It indicates that the effective reproduction number goes down as maximum temperature or relative humidity rise. But, the regression coefficient R2 is low for these correlations which means that the correlation is not strong.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

To evaluate the efficacy of the countering strategies in different periods, we constructed a SEIADR (susceptible-exposed-infected-asymptomatic-documented-recovered) model to simulate the cases and determined corresponding spreading coefficients. The effective reproduction number R(t) was obtained to evaluate the measures controlling the COVID-19 conducted by the Government of Japan during different stages. It was found that the strict containing strategies during the state of emergency period drastically inhibit the COVID-19 trend. R(t) was decreased to 1.1123 and 0.8911 in stages 4 and 5 (a state of emergency in April and May 2020) from 3.5736, 2.0126, 3.0672 in the previous three stages when the containing strategies were weak. The state of emergency was declared again in view of the second wave of massive infections in January 2021. We estimated the cumulative infected cases and additional days to contain the COVID-19 transmission for the second state of emergency using this model. R(t) was 1.028 which illustrated that the strategies were less effective than the previous state of emergency. Finally, the overall infected population was predicted using combined isolation and testing intensity; the effectiveness and the expected peak time were evaluated. If using the optimized control strategies in the current stage, the spread of COVID-19 in Japan could be controlled within 30 days.

This study assessed the impact of the L5 lockdown and its association with the incidence of COVID-19 cases in South Africa (SA). METHODS: data was obtained from the National Department of Health (NDoH) from the 5(th) March to the 30(th) April 2020. A basic reproductive number (R0) and a serial interval were used to calculate estimated cases (EC). A double exponential smoothing model was used to forecast the number of cases during the L5 lockdown period. A Poisson regression model was fitted to describe the association between L5 lockdown status and incident cases. RESULTS: a total of 5,737 laboratory-confirmed cases (LCC) were reported by 30(th) April 2020, 4,785 (83%) occurred during L5 lockdown. Our model forecasted 30,629 cases of COVID-19 assuming L5 lockdown was not imposed. High incidence rates of COVID-19 were recorded in KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga Provinces during the L5 lockdown compared to the other provinces. Nationally, the incident rate of COVID-19 was 68.00% higher in L5 lockdown than pre-lockdown for LCC. CONCLUSION: the L5 lockdown was very effective in reducing the incidence of COVID-19 cases. However, the incident rates of LCC and EC were higher nationally, and in some provinces during the L5 lockdown.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, social distancing rules have put the use of public spaces in densely populated places under strain, and this is especially important as some of the most virulent outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic have been in compact cities. It is therefore fundamental to take into account each neighbourhood's morphological characteristics and the potential population densities each street, square or park can accommodate under such new regulations in order to effectively enforce social distancing rules. Otherwise, certain areas may be rapidly overwhelmed by crowds with citizens unable to maintain the minimum safe distance between individuals. In this paper, we develop a method to identify the potential public space accessibility if social distancing rules are followed and we apply it to three global and highly affected by COVID-19 cities. Our research finds that, at micro level there are important inequalities between neighbourhoods, so people will struggle to comply with social distancing rules and consequently it will make controlling infection rates more difficult.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

To investigate the effect of dengue and Zika cocirculation on the spread of both pathogens, we create a deterministic dengue and Zika coinfection model, the first to incorporate altered infectivity of mosquitoes (due to coinfection). The model also addresses increased infectivity due to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) within the human population. Central to our analysis is the derivation and interpretation of the basic reproductive number and invasion reproductive number of both pathogens. In addition, we investigate how model parameters impact the persistence of each disease. Our results identify threshold conditions under which one disease facilitates the spread of the other and show that ADE has a greater impact on disease persistence than altered vector infectivity. This work highlights the importance of ADE and illustrates that while the endemic presence of dengue facilitates the spread of Zika, it is possible for high Zika prevalence to prevent the establishment of dengue.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

A mathematical model was formulated based on non-linear ordinary differential equations considering young (60 years old or less) and elder (60 years old or more) subpopulations, aiming to describe the introduction and dissemination of the new coronavirus in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo. This deterministic model used the data collected from S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo to estimate the model parameters, obtaining R(0) = 6.8 for the basic reproduction number. The model also allowed to estimate that 50% of the population of S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo was in isolation, which permitted to describe the current epidemiological status. The goal of isolation implemented in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo to control the rapid increase of the new coronavirus epidemic was partially succeeded, concluding that if isolation of at least 80% of the population had been implemented, the collapse in the health care system could be avoided. Nevertheless, the isolated persons must be released one day. Based on this model, we studied the potential epidemiological scenarios of release by varying the proportions of the release of young and elder persons. We also evaluated three different strategies of release: All isolated persons are released simultaneously, two and three releases divided in equal proportions. The better scenarios occurred when young persons are released, but maintaining elder persons isolated for a while. When compared with the epidemic without isolation, all strategies of release did not attain the goal of reducing substantially the number of hospitalisations due to severe CoViD-19.

In this paper, we try to analyze the variation of the COVID-19 pandemic in different countries in the light of some modifications to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. The SIR model was modified by taking time-dependent rate parameters. From this modified SIR model, the basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number, herd immunity, and herd immunity threshold are redefined. The re-outbreak of the COVID-19 is a real threat to various countries. We have used the above-mentioned quantities to find the reasons behind the re-outbreak of this disease. Also, the effectiveness of herd immunity to prevent an epidemic has been analyzed with respect to this model. We have also tried to show that there are certain universal aspects in the spread and containment of the disease in various countries for a short period of time. Finally, we have also analyzed the current pandemic situation in India and have attempted to discuss the possibilities in order to predict its future behavior using our model.

                "prompt": "Theoretically quantifying the direct and indirect benefits of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in terms of avoided deaths\nThe Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID)-19 pandemic has placed unprecedented pressures on societies around the world. Successful vaccines, developed against the spike protein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus, offer hope that new hospitalisations and new deaths will subside. However, vaccination takes place in a dynamic environment. For example, new variants of the disease may occur where the effectiveness of a vaccine lies below that of the original target of the vaccine, while changes in the behaviour of a population are accompanied by a changed basic reproduction number. Here, we aim to understand how changes in values of basic parameters affect the benefits of vaccination at the direct level, of the individuals vaccinated, and at the indirect level, of the wider, unvaccinated community. We work within the framework of a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model, and produce a metric for the benefits of vaccination, at both direct and indirect levels, in terms of the number of avoided deaths. Taking into account the initial prevalence of a SARS-CoV-2 infection, the mortality rate of the disease, the basic reproduction number, the vaccination rate, and the effectiveness of a vaccine, we explore how these basic parameters affect the benefits of vaccination. We find a range of situations where indirect benefits of vaccination outweigh direct benefits. This especially occurs at lower rates of vaccination (20% \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 [Formula: see text] ) and intermediate values of the basic reproduction number (1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.5). The indirect benefits can be substantial, in some cases being more than 400% of the direct benefits. For an initial prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 2%, a basic reproduction number of 1.2, a mortality rate of 2%, and a vaccine effectiveness of 95%, our findings show, for a population of 500,000 people, where 100,000 susceptible individuals are vaccinated, that approximately 2200 deaths are avoided. However, approximately 600 of these deaths are avoided amongst vaccinated individuals, while approximately 1600 deaths are avoided in the wider, unvaccinated community.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We used the SIRD (Susceptibles-Infectious-Recovered-Dead) model to describe the past data and to simulate strategies for the gradual mitigation of the epidemic curve by applying non-pharmacological measures. Besides the SIRD model does not include some aspects of COVID-19, as the symptomatic and asymptomatic subgroups of individuals and the incubation period, for example, in this work we intend to use a classical and easy to handle model to introduce a thorough method of adjustment that allows us to achieve reliable fitting for the real data and to obtain insights about the current trends for the pandemic in each locality. Our results demonstrate that for localities for which the ERN is about 2, only rigid measures are efficient to avoid overwhelming the health care system. These findings corroborate the relevance of keeping the value of the ERN below 1 and applying containment measures early.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The objective of this study is to carry out a rigorous mathematical analysis of a communicable disease transmission model with quarantine (of latent cases) and isolation (of symptomatic cases), in which the waiting periods in the infected classes are assumed to have gamma distributions. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that it has a globally-asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever its associated reproduction number is less than unity. The model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the threshold quantity exceeds unity. The endemic equilibrium is shown to be locally and globally-asymptotically stable for special cases. Numerical simulations, using data related to the 2003 SARS outbreaks, show that the cumulative number of disease-related mortality increases with increasing number of disease stages. Furthermore, the cumulative number of new cases is higher if the asymptomatic period is distributed such that most of the period is spent in the early stages of the asymptomatic compartments in comparison to the cases where the average time period is equally distributed among the associated stages or if most of the time period is spent in the later (final) stages of the asymptomatic compartments. Finally, it is shown that distributing the average sojourn time in the infectious (asymptomatic) classes equally or unequally does not effect the cumulative number of new cases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Faced with this threat and no effective treatment, in line with many other countries, the UK adopted enforced social distancing (lockdown) to reduce transmission-successfully reducing the reproductive number R below one. However, given the large pool of susceptible individuals that remain, complete relaxation of controls is likely to generate a substantial further outbreak. Vaccination remains the only foreseeable means of both containing the infection and returning to normal interactions and behaviour. Here, we consider the optimal targeting of vaccination within the UK, with the aim of minimising future deaths or quality adjusted life year (QALY) losses. We show that, for a range of assumptions on the action and efficacy of the vaccine, targeting older age groups first is optimal and may be sufficient to stem the epidemic if the vaccine prevents transmission as well as disease.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods: The incidence data and epidemic information of COVID-19 reported in Ningbo as of 9 March, 2020 were collected, and based on the implementation of prevention and control strategies, we developed a SEIR epidemic dynamics model. The basic and real-time reproduction numbers were calculated to evaluate effectiveness of prevention and control. Results: A total of 157 cases of COVID-19 were confirmed, without death, in Ningbo. The proportion of severe cases was 12.1%. The mean incubation period was estimated to be (5.7\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b12.9) days. The mean interval from illness onset to diagnosis was (5.4\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b13.7) days. The mean duration from diagnosis to hospital discharge was (16.6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b16.5) days. A total of 105 339 contacts had been under medical observation. The infection rates in contacts with home quarantine and centralized quarantine were 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively. In the confirmed cases, those who had been under medical observation before diagnoses accounted for 63.1%. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 4.8. With the strengthening of prevention and control measures, real-time reproduction number showed a gradual downward trend, dropping to below 1.0 on 4 February, and then continued to drop to 0.2 in mid-February.

Using a model that incorporates daily testing information fit to the case and serology data from New York City, we show that the proportion of symptomatic cases is low, ranging from 13 to 18%, and that the reproductive number may be larger than often assumed. Asymptomatic infections contribute substantially to herd immunity, and to community transmission together with presymptomatic ones. If asymptomatic infections transmit at similar rates as symptomatic ones, the overall reproductive number across all classes is larger than often assumed, with estimates ranging from 3.2 to 4.4. If they transmit poorly, then symptomatic cases have a larger reproductive number ranging from 3.9 to 8.1. Even in this regime, presymptomatic and asymptomatic cases together comprise at least 50% of the force of infection at the outbreak peak. We find no regimes in which all infection subpopulations have reproductive numbers lower than three. These findings elucidate the uncertainty that current case and serology data cannot resolve, despite consideration of different model structures. They also emphasize how temporal data on testing can reduce and better define this uncertainty, as we move forward through longer surveillance and second epidemic waves. Complementary information is required to determine the transmissibility of asymptomatic cases, which we discuss. Regardless, current assumptions about the basic reproductive number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov-2) should be reconsidered.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Despite this, little is known about their epidemiological dynamics, including the role of asymptomatic shedding in transmission; the durations of virus incubation and shedding; and the effect of immune responses on risk for re-infection during the same season. We studied respiratory virus shedding in military recruits, and used mathematical models to measure pathogen-specific transmission rates and durations of incubation, shedding, and immune protection. METHODS: We tested for shedding of HCoVs, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs in nasal samples collected from 78 military recruits entering basic training and then at staggered, biweekly visits over 65 days during winter 2017. We developed a continuous-time Markov chain model for virus acquisition and clearance, and used Bayesian methods to estimate model parameters for each of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs. RESULTS: We observed widespread transmission of HCoV-229E, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs within the first week after entry into basic training, and a subsequent phase of transmission predominantly involving HCoV-OC43 during the second month (Figure). We estimated pre-epidemic reproductive numbers ranging from 1.97 (95% credible interval: 1.49, 2.60) for HCoV-OC43 to 5.69 (3.92, 7.98) for HCoV-229E (Table). Subjects re-acquired HCoV-229E, rhinoviruses, and NPEVs despite previous exposure; for these pathogens, we estimated reversion to pre-infection susceptibility to occur, on average, 28.5 (15.8, 49.7) days, 52.2 (22.3, 151.1), and 144.7 (61.3, 812.5) days, respectively, following clearance of viral shedding. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic shedding is a source of transmission of common respiratory viruses in the close-contact basic training environment. Protection against re-acquisition is short-lived, and may be inadequate to prevent re-infection by rhinoviruses and NPEVs within a season. Estimated durations of shedding and incubation periods provide a basis for modeling pathogen spread and informing isolation protocols. DISCLOSURES: J.

This study was conducted to guide the Qatari national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) epidemic. The study investigated the epidemic's time-course, forecasted health care needs, predicted the impact of social and physical distancing restrictions, and rationalized and justified easing of restrictions. Methods: An age-structured deterministic model was constructed to describe SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics and disease progression throughout the population. Results: The enforced social and physical distancing interventions flattened the epidemic curve, reducing the peaks for incidence, prevalence, acute-care hospitalization, and intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalizations by 87%, 86%, 76%, and 78%, respectively. The daily number of new infections was predicted to peak at 12 750 on May 23, and active-infection prevalence was predicted to peak at 3.2% on May 25. Daily acute-care and ICU-care hospital admissions and occupancy were forecast accurately and precisely. By October 15, 2020, the basic reproduction number R0 had varied between 1.07-2.78, and 50.8% of the population were estimated to have been infected (1.43 million infections). The proportion of actual infections diagnosed was estimated at 11.6%. Applying the concept of Rt tuning, gradual easing of restrictions was rationalized and justified to start on June 15, 2020, when Rt declined to 0.7, to buffer the increased interpersonal contact with easing of restrictions and to minimize the risk of a second wave. No second wave has materialized as of October 15, 2020, five months after the epidemic peak.

This study aimed to model the spread of COVID-19 in Iran and to estimate the epidemic parameters and to predict the short-term future trend of COVID-19 in Iran. Methods: We proposed a modified SEIR epidemic spreading model and we used data from February 20, 2020, to April 9, 2021, on the number of cases reported by Iranian governments to fit the proposed model on the reported data. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm was employed to estimate the parameters of the proposed model and the numerical simulation results were obtained by Runge-Kutta method. The estimated parameters were employed to calculate the effective reproduction number and to predict the short-term future trends of COVID-19 cases. Results: The results indicated that the effective reproduction number has increased during Nowruz (Persian New Year) and it was estimated to be 1.28. Considering only two exposed cases as the initial cases in the model, the cumulative number of exposed cases was estimated to be 15,252,372 individuals since the beginning of the outbreak. The prediction of the short-term future trends of COVID-19 cases with different scenarios showed that another peak of the pandemic cases occurs in the next weeks. By immediate lockdown implementation the number of active infected cases was estimated to be 397,585.

Global research efforts have focused on developing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes, COVID-19. However, some of the basic epidemiological parameters, such as the exponential epidemic growth rate and the basic reproductive number, R0, across geographic areas are still not well quantified. Here, we developed and fit a mathematical model to case and death count data collected from the United States and eight European countries during the early epidemic period before broad control measures were implemented. Results show that the early epidemic grew exponentially at rates between 0.19-0.29/day (epidemic doubling times between 2.4-3.6 days). We discuss the current estimates of the mean serial interval, and argue that existing evidence suggests that the interval is between 6-8 days in the absence of active isolation efforts. Using parameters consistent with this range, we estimated the median R0 value to be 5.8 (confidence interval: 4.7-7.3) in the United States and between 3.6 and 6.1 in the eight European countries. This translates to herd immunity thresholds needed to stop transmission to be between 73% and 84%.

It simulates the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province before 'lockdown of Wuhan city'. The second stage is the new transmission dynamics model proposed in this paper and referred to as SEIRQH. It takes into account the influence over the COVID-19 epidemic from the series of strategies taken by Chinese government, such as travel restriction, contact tracing, centralized treatment, the asymptomatic infected patients, hospitalized patients and so on. It simulates the COVID-19 epidemic in China after 'lockdown of Wuhan city'. The least square method is used to estimate the parameters of the SEIR derived model and the SEIRQH model based on the collected data of COVID-19 from Hubei Province and the mainland of China before April 30, 2020. The experimental results found that the SEIR derived model simulates the actual data in Hubei Province before 'lockdown of Wuhan city', and the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province is 3.2035. The SEIRQH model simulates the number of the hospitalized persons of COVID-19 in Hubei Province and the mainland of China after the 'lockdown of Wuhan city' perfectly. The control reproductive number is 0.11428 and 0.09796 in Hubei Province and the mainland of China, respectively. Our two-stage dynamics transmission model simulates the COVID-19 epidemic in China, especially our SEIRQH model simulates the actual data very well. The strategies taken by Chinese government are effective, and plays significant role in preventing the spread of COVID-19 epidemic in China.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to obtain more robust estimates of the incubation period, serial interval, frequency of presymptomatic transmission, and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 based on a large case series. METHODS: We systematically retrieved and screened 20,658 reports of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases released by the health authorities of China, Japan, and Singapore. In addition, 9942 publications were retrieved from PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) through April 8, 2020. To be eligible, a report had to contain individual data that allowed for accurate estimation of at least one parameter. Widely used models such as gamma distributions were fitted to the data sets and the results with the best-fitting values were presented. RESULTS: In total, 1591 cases were included for the final analysis. The mean incubation period (n=687) and mean serial interval (n=1015 pairs) were estimated to be 7.04 (SD 4.27) days and 6.49 (SD 4.90) days, respectively. In 40 cases (5.82%), the incubation period was longer than 14 days. In 32 infector-infectee pairs (3.15%), infectees' symptom onsets occurred before those of infectors. Presymptomatic transmission occurred in 129 of 296 infector-infectee pairs (43.58%). R0 was estimated to be 1.85 (95% CI 1.37-2.60). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides robust estimates of several epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. The findings support the current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure, but also suggest the need for additional measures. Presymptomatic transmission together with the asymptomatic transmission reported by previous studies highlight the importance of adequate testing, strict quarantine, and social distancing.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Unfortunately, to our best knowledge, the existing models are based on the common assumption that the total population follows a homogeneous spatial distribution, which is not the case for the prevalence occurred both in the community and in hospital due to the difference in the contact rate. To solve this problem, we propose a novel epidemic model called SEIR-HC, which is a model with two different social circles (i.e., individuals in hospital and community). Using the model alongside the exclusive optimization algorithm, the spread process of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city is reproduced and then the propagation characteristics and unknown data are estimated. The basic reproduction number of COVID-19 is estimated to be 7.9, which is far higher than that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Furthermore, the control measures implemented in Wuhan are assessed and the control methodology of COVID-19 is discussed to provide guidance for limiting the epidemic spread.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This investigation of Rt estimations was conducted to guide the national COVID-19 response in Qatar, from the onset of the epidemic until August 18, 2021. Methods: Real-time empirical RtEmpirical was estimated using five methods, including the Robert Koch Institute, Cislaghi, Systrom-Bettencourt and Ribeiro, Wallinga and Teunis, and Cori et al. methods. Rt was also estimated using a transmission dynamics model (RtModel-based). Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses were conducted. Agreements between different Rt estimates were assessed by calculating correlation coefficients. Results: RtEmpirical captured the evolution of the epidemic through three waves, public health response landmarks, effects of major social events, transient fluctuations coinciding with significant clusters of infection, and introduction and expansion of the B.1.1.7 variant. The various estimation methods produced consistent and overall comparable RtEmpirical estimates with generally large correlation coefficients. The Wallinga and Teunis method was the fastest at detecting changes in epidemic dynamics. RtEmpirical estimates were consistent whether using time series of symptomatic PCR-confirmed cases, all PCR-confirmed cases, acute-care hospital admissions, or ICU-care hospital admissions, to proxy trends in true infection incidence. RtModel-based correlated strongly with RtEmpirical and provided an average RtEmpirical. Conclusions: Rt estimations were robust and generated consistent results regardless of the data source or the method of estimation. Findings affirmed an influential role for Rt estimations in guiding national responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, even in resource-limited settings.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This study focuses on the pattern of infection over the last 13 months utilizing epidemic model to predict course of the pandemic. Material and methodsThe data was collected from covid19india.org to perform analysis based on age and gender distribution. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the relation between confirmed and recovered cases while SIR epidemic model was used to determine the course of the pandemic in the country and the changes that have occurred from the first to the second wave. Results and discussionsResults show infectivity rate to be higher in ages 20-50 while mortality is higher in 50-80 age group while 60-70% of the infected population are males. Each of the 9 states have their own salient feature curves of infection. It was seen that the confirmed and recovered cases are more correlated at present than previous wave. The curves for both waves show a polynomial distribution while the reproduction number data shows an almost U-shaped curve indicating decrease of infection spread in the middle phase when the first wave was on a decline before picking up again owing to the second wave. Interpretations and conclusionThe gender and age distribution shows that although lower age group is more infected, mortality is high for higher age groups, on the other hand males are more prone to the infection.

The tests are based on simulated data, generated by means of a deterministic compartmental epidemiological model \\cite{Matsinos2020a}, adapted herein to also include the possibility of the loss of immunity by the group of the recovered (or vaccinated) subjects. Assuming a simple temporal dependence of the effective reproduction number (the exact details are of no relevance as far as the conclusions of this work are concerned), time series of new cases were generated in a time domain of nearly one year for the five top-ranking countries in the cumulative number of infections by January 1, 2021. These countries are (in descending order of infections): the United States of America, India, Brazil, Russia, and the United Kingdom. The processing of each simulated time series led to the establishment of relations between the input (actual) and the reconstructed values of the effective reproduction number for each country and algorithm, separately; this work argues that all five algorithms underestimate the effective reproduction number when the latter exceeds the critical value of $1$. The five algorithms were subsequently applied to the real-life time series of new cases for the aforementioned five countries, which also span a temporal interval of nearly one year; corrected values of the effective reproduction number are obtained for these countries in 2020.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

They have different levels of tolerance to opioid effects which challenge the anesthesiologists in search of safe and effective opioid dosing perioperatively. The tested hypothesis is that simple measures introduced will allow us to measure tolerance qualitatively. Opioid effects on pain (analgesia) and dyspnea sensations (relieving effect) are tested. Patients were allocated to three groups according to pre-operative analgesics: (1) control, without any opioid analgesics, (2) weak opioid, and (3) strong opioid. Pressure pain threshold (PPT) and no-respiratory sensation period (NRSP) were measured at two points: before and 3 min after intravenous fentanyl administration. RESULTS: A total of 58 (43 controls, 9 weak opioids, and 6 strong opioids) patients were enrolled. PPT and NRSP, after iv 2 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b5g/kg ideal body weight (IBW) fentanyl, were significantly elevated in the control patients (PPT: 6.2 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 2.1 N to 9.2 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 3.9 N, p < 0.0001, NRSP: 17.8 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 10.8 s to 22.8 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 18.7 s, p < 0.005, paired t test). However, preoperative opioid use, though with tendency, did not show a significant decrease of the opioid effect. Due to an insufficient number of participants, no conclusion could be drawn. Further analysis of the data from control patients showed a significant difference between the two sexes in sensitivity to PPT and NRSP, as well as fentanyl effect on PPT. CONCLUSIONS: Current data showed a simple method of measuring the opioid effect on two dimensions: pain and respiration. Though not able to show a qualitative measurement of tolerance formation in opioid-users, data from control patients showed females to be more sensitive to pain and dyspnea but is less sensitive to the opioid effect. Further studies are necessary to show whether these gender differences serve as clinical relevance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN, UMIN 000011580.

METHODS: Total number of reported cases were plotted against total number of tests for COVID-19 performed over time, with and without smoothing, for Canada and some Canadian provinces individually. Changes in curvature profile were identified as either convex or concave as indicators of pandemic acceleration or deceleration, respectively. R(t) estimates were calculated on an exponential growth rate. RESULTS: For Canada as a whole, the testing graphs had a slightly concave profile and a coincident decrease in R(t) estimates. Saskatchewan more recently had a convex profile with a gradual shift to a concave profile and also demonstrated a gradual decline in R(t) estimates. Curves and R(t) estimates for Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Quebec displayed a gradual shift towards concavity over time and an overall decrease in R(t) estimates, which is suggestive of a positive impact of public health interventions implemented federally and provincially. CONCLUSION: The present analyses compared a mathematical tool to R(t) estimates to ascertain the status of the pandemic in Canada. Caution should be taken when interpreting results due to factors such as varying testing protocols, available testing data unique to each province and limitations inherent to each method, which may generate different results using the two approaches.

We found that the infection rate rapidly grew up to 0.3647 at phase II from 0.1100 at phase I and went down to 0.0600 and 0.0006 at phase III and IV, respectively. The reproduction numbers of COVID-19 were 10.7843, 13.8144, 1.4815, and 0.0137 at phase I, II, III, and IV, respectively. These results suggest that intensive interventions, including compulsory home isolation and rapid improvement of medical resources, can effectively reduce the COVID-19 transmission. Furthermore, the predicted COVID-19 epidemic trend by our models was close to the actual epidemic trend in Wuhan. Our phase-based SEIR models demonstrate that intensive intervention measures can effectively control COVID-19 spread even without specific medicines and vaccines against this disease.

A prevalent method of modeling the spread of pandemics is to categorize individuals in the population as belonging to one of several distinct compartments, which represents their health status with regard to the pandemic.

In many epidemic outbreaks, the number of reported infections is likely much lower than the actual number of infections which can be calculated from the model\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s parameters derived from reported case data. The analysis is applied to the COVID-19 pandemic for several countries in the Gulf region and Europe.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Engineering CRISPR immune systems conferring GLRaV-3 resistance in grapevine\nGrapevine leafroll-associated virus 3 (GLRaV-3) is one of the causal agents of grapevine leafroll disease (GLD), which severely impacts grapevine production in most viticultural regions of the world. The development of virus-resistant plants is a desirable strategy for the efficient control of viral diseases. However, natural resistant resources have not been reported in the genus Vitis, and anti-GLRaV-3 research has been quite limited in grapevine. In this study, by expressing FnCas9 and LshCas13a, we established a highly effective transgenic construct screening system via an optimized Agrobacterium-mediated transient delivery system in grapevine plantlets. Our study indicated that CRISPR/FnCas9 and LshCas13a caused GLRaV-3 inhibition. Moreover, three vectors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dpCR01-CP, pCR11-Hsp70h and pCR11-CP\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dexhibited the most robust inhibition efficiency compared to those targeting other sites and could be further engineered to generate GLRaV-3-resistant grapevine. In addition, the viral interference efficiency of FnCas9 was dependent on its RNA binding activity. The efficiency of virus inhibition was positively correlated with the level of Cas gene expression. Importantly, we demonstrated that LshCas13a had better interference efficiency against viruses than FnCas9. In summary, this study confirmed that these two RNA-targeting CRISPR mechanisms can confer immunity against viruses in grapevine, providing new avenues to control GLRaV-3 or other RNA viruses in fruit crops.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "An epidemic model integrating direct and fomite transmission as well as household structure applied to COVID-19\nThis paper stresses its base contribution on a new SIR-type model including direct and fomite transmission as well as the effect of distinct household structures. The model derivation is modulated by several mechanistic processes inherent from typical airborne diseases. The notion of minimum contact radius is included in the direct transmission, facilitating the arguments on physical distancing. As fomite transmission heavily relates to former-trace of sneezes, the vector field of the system naturally contains an integral kernel with time delay indicating the contribution of undetected and non-quarantined asymptomatic cases in accumulating the historical contamination of surfaces. We then increase the complexity by including the different transmission routines within and between households. For airborne diseases, within-household interactions play a significant role in the propagation of the disease rendering countrywide effect. Two steps were taken to include the effect of household structure. The first step subdivides the entire compartments (susceptible, exposed, asymptomatic, symptomatic, recovered, death) into the household level and different infection rates for the direct transmission within and between households were distinguished. Under predefined conditions and assumptions, the governing system on household level can be raised to the community level. The second step then raises the governing system to the country level, where the final state variables estimate the total individuals from all compartments in the country. Two key attributes related to the household structure (number of local households and number of household members) effectively classify countries to be of low or high risk in terms of effective disease propagation. The basic reproductive number is calculated and its biological meaning is invoked properly. The numerical methods for solving the DIDE-system and the parameter estimation problem were mentioned. Our optimal model solutions are in quite good agreement with datasets of COVID-19 active cases and related deaths from Germany and Sri Lanka in early infection, allowing us to hypothesize several unobservable situations in the two countries. Focusing on extending minimum contact radius and reducing the intensity of individual activities, we were able to synthesize the key parameters telling what to practice.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Increased urbanization reduced the effectiveness of school closures on seasonal influenza epidemics in China\nBACKGROUND: School closure is a common mitigation strategy during severe influenza epidemics and pandemics. However, the effectiveness of this strategy remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to explore the effectiveness of school closure on seasonal influenza epidemics in provincial-level administrative divisions (PLADs) with varying urbanization rates in China. METHODS: This study analyzed influenza surveillance data between 2010 and 2019 provided by the Chinese National Influenza Center. Taking into consideration the climate, this study included a region with 3 adjacent PLADs in Northern China and another region with 4 adjacent PLADs in Southern China. The effect of school closure on influenza transmission was evaluated by the reduction of the effective reproductive number of seasonal influenza during school winter breaks compared with that before school winter breaks. An age-structured Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) model was built to model influenza transmission in different levels of urbanization. Parameters were determined using the surveillance data via robust Bayesian method. RESULTS: Between 2010 and 2019, in the less urbanized provinces: Hebei, Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Anhui, during school winter breaks, the effective reproductive number of seasonal influenza epidemics reduced 14.6% [95% confidential interval (CI): 6.2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015322.9%], 9.6% (95% CI: 2.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015316.6%), 7.3% (95% CI: 0.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015314.4%) and 8.2% (95% CI: 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015315.3%) respectively. However, in the highly urbanized cities: Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai, it reduced only 5.2% (95% CI: -0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015311.2%), 4.1% (95% CI: -0.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01539.1%) and 3.9% (95% CI: -1.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01539.4%) respectively. In China, urbanization is associated with decreased proportion of children and increased social contact. According to the SIRS model, both factors could reduce the impact of school closure on seasonal influenza epidemics, and the proportion of children in the population is thought to be the dominant influencing factor. CONCLUSIONS: Effectiveness of school closure on the epidemics varies with the age structure in the population and social contact patterns. School closure should be recommended in the low urbanized regions in China in the influenza seasons.

We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). METHODS: We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. RESULTS: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. CONCLUSION: Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia. The virus is likely to have entered Victoria and already become established around the time it was first identified in the US and Mexico.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Antiviral resistance during pandemic influenza: implications for stockpiling and drug use\nBACKGROUND: The anticipated extent of antiviral use during an influenza pandemic can have adverse consequences for the development of drug resistance and rationing of limited stockpiles. The strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses. METHODS: We employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential, and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections. Using estimated parameters in the published literature, the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high. However, moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles, leading to run-out, by promoting wide-spread drug resistance. We applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. Our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak, a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude. However, a timely implementation of wide-scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population, and minimize the final size of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run-out. For a 1918-like strain, the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20% of the population.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Spatio-temporal harmonisation is carried out so that the indicator can provide mobility estimates comparable across European countries. The indicators are provided at a high spatial granularity (up to NUTS3). As an application, the indicator is used to study the impact of COVID-19 confinement measure on mobility in Europe. It is found that a large proportion of the change in mobility patterns can be explained by these measures.

Currently, many countries vaccinate their population in descending order of age to minimize the deaths caused by the disease;however, the effectiveness of this strategy needs to be quantitatively assessed. We employed the susceptible-infected-recovered-dead (SIRD) model to investigate various vaccination strategies. In complex network, the case fatality rate (CFR)-based method was shown to be more effective than the load-based strategy when there is a low supply of vaccine;however, when there is a sufficient quantity of vaccine, the load-based strategy is more effective than the CFR-based strategy. We also constructed a metapopulation model with empirical human contact and CFR data for SARS-CoV-2 and investigated vaccination strategies. We found that the age-based strategy, which is currently employed in many countries, is more effective when the basic reproduction number is high and vaccination supply is low, but the rate-based method outperforms the age-based strategy when there is sufficiently high supply of vaccine. Simulated annealing is performed to find the optimal vaccination strategy. We identified a first-order phase transition in the vaccination strategies which is characterized by discontinuous transition in the optimal strategy and the hysteresis. This phase transition implies that mixing the age-based and rate-based strategy is ineffective in reducing the number of deaths. These conclusions are valid even when the heterogeneous degree distribution of human contact is considered.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We sought to investigate the variability in transmissibility of H1N1 pandemic in different health regions (including urban centres and remote, isolated communities) in the province of Manitoba, Canada. METHODS: The Richards model was used to fit to the daily number of laboratory-confirmed cases and estimate transmissibility (referred to as the basic reproduction number, R(0)), doubling times, and turning points of outbreaks in both spring and fall waves of the H1N1 pandemic in several health regions. RESULTS: We observed considerable variation in R(0 )estimates ranging from 1.55 to 2.24, with confidence intervals ranging from 1.45 to 2.88, for an average generation time of 2.9 days, and shorter doubling times in some remote and isolated communities compared to urban centres, suggesting a more rapid spread of disease in these communities during the first wave. For the second wave, R(e), the effective reproduction number, is estimated to be lower for remote and isolated communities; however, outbreaks appear to have been driven by somewhat higher transmissibility in urban centres. CONCLUSIONS: There was considerable geographic variation in transmissibility of the 2009 pandemic outbreaks.

Simulation studies helped quantify the performance of our approach in the context of an emerging pathogen, where human-to-human transmission is limited and most cases arise from spillover events. We also used alternative approaches to estimate R based on individual-level information on prior exposure and compared the transmission potential of influenza A/H7N9 with that of other recent zoonoses. RESULTS: Estimates of R for the A/H7N9 outbreak were below the epidemic threshold required for sustained human-to-human transmission and remained near 0.1 throughout the study period, with broad 95% credible intervals by the Bayesian method (0.01 to 0.49). The Bayesian estimation approach was dominated by the prior distribution, however, due to relatively little information contained in the case data. We observe a statistically significant deceleration in growth rate after 6 April 2013, which is consistent with a reduction in A/H7N9 transmission associated with the preemptive closure of live bird markets. Although confidence intervals are broad, the estimated transmission potential of A/H7N9 appears lower than that of recent zoonotic threats, including avian influenza A/H5N1, swine influenza H3N2sw and Nipah virus. CONCLUSION: Although uncertainty remains high in R estimates for H7N9 due to limited epidemiological information, all available evidence points to a low transmission potential. Continued monitoring of the transmission potential of A/H7N9 is critical in the coming months as intervention measures may be relaxed and seasonal factors could promote disease transmission in colder months.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this study, we analysed the serial interval of household transmission pairs infected with SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 variant and compared with those who were infected prior to the occurrence of the major global SARS-CoV-2 variants. After controlling for confounding factors, our findings suggest no significant changes in the serial intervals for SARS-CoV-2 cases infected with the B.1.617.2 variant.

There is currently no vaccine or therapeutics and several interventions, mostly preventive measures have been proposed to reduce the spread of infection but the efficacy of these interventions, and their likely impact on the number of COVID-19 infections is unknown. In this study, we proposed the SEIQHRS model (susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantine-hospitalized-recovered-susceptible) model that predicts the trajectory of the epidemic to help plan an effective control strategy for COVID-19 in Ghana. We provided a short-term forecast of the early phase of the epidemic trajectory in Ghana using the generalized growth model. We estimated the effective basic Reproductive number Re in real-time using three different estimation procedures and simulated worse case epidemic scenarios and the impact of integrated individual and government interventions on the epidemic in the long term using compartmental models. The maximum likelihood estimates of Re and the corresponding 95% confidence interval was 2.04 [95% CI: 1.82\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.27; 12th March-7th April 2020].

METHODS: We developed a microsimulation model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a homeless shelter and calibrated it to data from cross-sectional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) surveys conducted during COVID-19 outbreaks in five homeless shelters in three US cities from March 28 to April 10, 2020. We estimated the probability of averting a COVID-19 outbreak when an exposed individual is introduced into a representative homeless shelter of 250 residents and 50 staff over 30 days under different infection control strategies, including daily symptom-based screening, twice-weekly PCR testing, and universal mask wearing. RESULTS: The proportion of PCR-positive residents and staff at the shelters with observed outbreaks ranged from 2.6 to 51.6%, which translated to the basic reproduction number (R0) estimates of 2.9-6.2. With moderate community incidence (~ 30 confirmed cases/1,000,000 people/day), the estimated probabilities of averting an outbreak in a low-risk (R0 = 1.5), moderate-risk (R0 = 2.9), and high-risk (R0 = 6.2) shelter were respectively 0.35, 0.13, and 0.04 for daily symptom-based screening; 0.53, 0.20, and 0.09 for twice-weekly PCR testing; 0.62, 0.27, and 0.08 for universal masking; and 0.74, 0.42, and 0.19 for these strategies in combination. The probability of averting an outbreak diminished with higher transmissibility (R0) within the simulated shelter and increasing incidence in the local community. CONCLUSIONS: In high-risk homeless shelter environments and locations with high community incidence of COVID-19, even intensive infection control strategies (incorporating daily symptom screening, frequent PCR testing, and universal mask wearing) are unlikely to prevent outbreaks, suggesting a need for non-congregate housing arrangements for people experiencing homelessness. In lower-risk environments, combined interventions should be employed to reduce outbreak risk.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

It establishes in an explicit way the extent of an epidemic spread process in a population. The current estimation methods for the time evolution of R(t), using incidence data, rely on the generation interval distribution, g(\\tau), which is usually obtained from empirical data or already known distributions from the literature. However, there are systems, especially highly heterogeneous ones, in which there is a lack of data and an adequate methodology to obtain g(\\tau). In this work, we use mathematical models to bridge this gap. We present a general methodology for obtaining an explicit expression of the reproduction numbers and the generation interval distributions provided by an arbitrary compartmental model. Additionally, we present the appropriate expressions to evaluate those reproduction numbers using incidence data. To highlight the relevance of such methodology, we apply it to the spread of Covid-19 in municipalities of the state of Rio de janeiro, Brazil. Using two meta-population models, we estimate the reproduction numbers and the contributions of each municipality in the generation of cases in all others.

We aimed to generate reliable and robust evidence of this relationship based on date of onset of symptoms. We evaluated important meteorological factors associated with daily COVID-19 counts and effective reproduction number (R(t)) in China using a two-stage approach with overdispersed generalized additive models and random-effects meta-analysis. Spatial heterogeneity and stratified analyses by sex and age groups were quantified and potential effect modification was analyzed. Nationwide, there was no evidence that temperature and relative humidity affected COVID-19 incidence and R(t). However, there were heterogeneous impacts on COVID-19 risk across different regions. Importantly, there was a negative association between relative humidity and COVID-19 incidence in Central China: a 1% increase in relative humidity was associated with a 3.92% (95% CI, 1.98% to 5.82%) decrease in daily counts. Older population appeared to be more sensitive to meteorological conditions, but there was no obvious difference between sexes. Linear relationships were found between meteorological variables and COVID-19 incidence. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the robustness of the association and the results based on report date were biased. Meteorological factors play heterogenous roles on COVID-19 transmission, increasing the possibility of seasonality and suggesting the epidemic is far from over.

FINDINGS: The Richards model and its variants are used to fit the cumulative epidemic curve for laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) infections in Canada, made available by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The model is used to obtain estimates for turning points in the initial outbreak, the basic reproductive number (R(0)), and for expected final outbreak size in the absence of interventions. Confirmed case data were used to construct a best-fit 2-phase model with three turning points. R(0 )was estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI 1.12-1.47) for the first phase (April 1 to May 4) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.16-1.54) for the second phase (May 4 to June 19). Hospitalization data were also used to fit a 1-phase model with R(0 )= 1.35 (1.20-1.49) and a single turning point of June 11. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the Richards model to Canadian pH1N1 data shows that detection of turning points is affected by the quality of data available at the time of data usage.

Methods: The provinces that reported more than 500 cases of COVID-19 till February 18, 2020 were selected as the major endemic areas. The Verhulst model was used to fit the growth rate of cumulative confirmed cases. The R(0) of COVID-19 was calculated using the parameters of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and COVID-19. The latent class of R(0) was analyzed using the latent profile analysis (LPA) model. Results: The median R(0) calculated from the SARS and COVID-19 parameters were 1.84\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.18 and 1.74\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.91, respectively.

Both R(0) can be divided into three latent classes. The initial value of R(0) in class 1 (Shandong Province, Sichuan Province, and Chongqing Municipality) was relatively low and decreased slowly. The initial value of R(0) in class 2 (Anhui Province, Hunan Province, Jiangxi Province, Henan Province, Zhejiang Province, Guangdong Province, and Jiangsu Province) was relatively high and decreased rapidly. Moreover, the initial R(0) value of class 3 (Hubei Province) was in the range between that of classes 1 and 2, but the higher R(0) level lasted longer and decreased slowly.

Consequentially, it is vital to understand how to best support elderly individuals, particularly Black Americans and people of low socioeconomic status, in navigating stressful situations during the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond. The aim of this study was to investigate perceived levels of stress, posttraumatic growth, coping strategies, socioeconomic status, and mental health between Black and non-Hispanic, White older adults, the majority over the age of 70. Additionally, we investigated which variables, if any, were associated with posttraumatic growth in these populations. METHODS: One hundred seventy-six community dwelling older adults (mean age = 76.30 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b18.94), part of two observational studies (The Harvard Aging Brain Study and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Study) in Massachusetts, US, were included in this cross-sectional study. The survey, conducted from March 23, 2021 to May 13, 2021, measured perceived stress, behavioral coping strategies, posttraumatic growth, and mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigated associations with post-traumatic growth in a multiple linear regression model and examined their differences by race with t-tests, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, and Fisher's exact tests. A second multiple linear regression model was used to examine which coping strategies were associated with posttraumatic growth. FINDINGS: Our results indicated no significant difference between the groups in terms of mental health or stress. However, Black participants showed significantly greater posttraumatic growth compared to non-Hispanic, White participants. Additionally, the coping strategies of religion and positive reframing were found to be significantly associated with posttraumatic growth. Furthermore, even with the effects of stress and coping strategies controlled for, race remained significantly associated with posttraumatic growth. INTERPRETATION: The COVID-19 pandemic has differentially impacted Black and non-Hispanic White older adults. These results may help encourage further analysis on geriatric psychiatry as well as understanding how cultural values and adaptations impact posttraumatic growth and mental health in diverse populations.

The control measures adopted in several countries aim at isolating individuals once diagnosed, limiting their social interactions and consequently their transmission probability. These interventions, which have a strong impact on the disease dynamics, can affect the inference of the epidemiological quantities. We first present a theoretical explanation of the effect caused by non-pharmaceutical intervention measures on the mean serial and generation intervals. Then, in a simulation study, we vary the assumed efficacy of control measures and quantify the effect on the mean and variance of realized generation and serial intervals. The simulation results show that the realized serial and generation intervals both depend on control measures and their values contract according to the efficacy of the intervention strategies. Interestingly, the mean serial interval differs from the mean generation interval. The deviation between these two values depends on two factors. First, the number of undiagnosed infectious individuals. Second, the relationship between infectiousness, symptom onset and timing of isolation. Similarly, the standard deviations of realized serial and generation intervals do not coincide, with the former shorter than the latter on average. The findings of this study are directly relevant to estimates performed for the current COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the effective reproduction number is often inferred using both daily incidence data and the generation interval. Failing to account for either contraction or mis-specification by using the serial interval could lead to biased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Consequently, this might affect the choices made by decision makers when deciding which control measures to apply based on the value of the quantity thereof.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Older adults may be especially susceptible to declines in sleep quality for multiple reasons, including their elevated risk of social isolation and loneliness during the pandemic. Given the adverse health consequences of poor sleep, there is a need to identify resilience factors that help protect older adults against decreased sleep quality. Social integration is a plausible resilience factor because involvement in a broad range of social relationships is thought to promote psychological well-being (e.g., meaning, purpose in life), as well as reduce the intensity and duration of negative psychological states. Social integration may also assume increased importance during the coronavirus pandemic because of normative declines in overall social contact. This prospective study assessed the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on older adults\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep quality and tested whether social integration moderated the impact of the pandemic on sleep quality. METHODS: A sample of 115 retired older adults (mean age = 68.6, 58% female, 89% white) completed self-report assessments of their social integration (number of roles on Cohen\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s Social Network Index) and sleep quality (global score on Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) before and after the onset of the coronavirus pandemic (mean duration of follow-up = 2.3 years). RESULTS: Multilevel analyses indicated that social integration moderated the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on sleep quality; there was no main effect of time. Older adults with low social integration had reduced sleep quality from Time 1 to Time 2 (b=.94, p=.02), whereas older adults with high social integration showed no changes in sleep quality over time (b=-.38, p=.37). CONCLUSION: Broader social networks confer resilience against pandemic-related declines in sleep quality among older adults. The level of social integration should be addressed when studying or treating sleep complaints during the coronavirus pandemic. Additional research is warranted to determine whether psychosocial interventions targeted towards older adults with low social integration can reduce observed differences in sleep quality.

It further calculates the levels of immunity required in order for these selfsame lockdown regimes to begin to work. The first, level-5 lockdown was a valiant attempt to contain the highly infectious, SARS-CoV-2 virus, based on a limited knowledge. Its basic reproduction number ($r_0 = 1.93$) never came anywhere close to the requirement of being less than unity. Obviously, it could be anticipated that the same would apply for subsequent, lower levels of lockdown. The basic reproduction number for the level-4 lockdown was found to be $1.69$. The suggestion is therefore that the level-4 lockdown might have been marginally `smarter' than the `harder', level-5 lockdown, although its basic reproduction number may merely reflect an adjustment by the public to the new normal, or the ever-present error associated with data sets, in general. The pandemic's basic reproduction number was calculated to be $3.09$, in the Swedish context. The lockdowns therefore served to ensure that the medical system was not overwhelmed, bought it valuable time to prepare and provided useful data. The lockdowns nonetheless failed significantly in meeting any objective to curtail the pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The reproduction number has been found to respond to public health interventions changing throughout the pandemic waves. However, the actual global burden of SARS-CoV-2 remains unknown due to severe under-ascertainment of cases. The use of reported deaths has been pointed out as a more reliable source of information, likely less prone to under-reporting. Given that daily deaths occur from past infections weighted by their probability of death, one may infer the true number of infections accounting for their age distribution, using the data on reported deaths. We adopt this framework and assume that the transmission dynamics generating the total number of underlying infections can be described by a continuous time transmission model expressed through a system of non-linear ordinary differential equations, where the transmission rate and consequently the reproduction number are stochastic. We model the transmission rate as a diffusion process, with distinct volatility phases for each pandemic wave, allowing to reveal both the effect of control strategies and the changes in individuals behavior. We study the case of 6 European countries and estimate the time-varying reproduction number ($R_t$) as well as the true cumulative number of infected individuals using Stan's No-U-Turn sampler variant of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. As we estimate the true number of infections through deaths, we offer a more accurate estimate of $R_t$. We also provide an estimate of the daily reporting ratio and discuss the effects of changes in mobility and testing to the inferred quantities.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This unmet need is exacerbated by the emergence and spread of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) that have shown some resistance to vaccine responses. Here we report the isolation of five neutralizing mAbs from an Indian convalescent donor, out of which two (THSC20.HVTR04 and THSC20.HVTR26) showed potent neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 VOCs at picomolar concentrations, including the Delta variant (B.1.617.2). One of these (THSC20.HVTR26) also retained activity against the Omicron variant. These two mAbs target non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein and prevent virus attachment to its host receptor, human angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (hACE2). Furthermore, the mAb cocktail demonstrated protection against the Delta variant at low antibody doses when passively administered in the K18 hACE2 transgenic mice model, highlighting their potential as a cocktail for prophylactic and therapeutic applications. Developing the capacity to rapidly discover and develop mAbs effective against highly transmissible pathogens like coronaviruses at a local level, especially in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) such as India, will enable prompt responses to future pandemics as an important component of global pandemic preparedness.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

From then on, much research has been done in the world with the aim of controlling this contagious disease.

As seen in many other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 also shows respiratory infection, but the basic reproductive number (R0) in transmission and the clinical latency are quite dissimilar from those of SARS-or MERS-CoVs. Many scientists infer that the time point of cross-barrier transfer from bats to mediate animals or to humans should be a rather recent event based on the full-length genome analyses obtained from the very first patients. Copy-choice polymerization, which often leads to a significant genome recombination rate in most coronaviruses, predicts the continued emergence of novel coronaviruses.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The early stages of such an outbreak can be modeled by a graph whose edges encode these interactions between individuals, the vertices. This article attempts to account for the case when each individual entails in different kinds of interactions which have therefore different probabilities of transmitting the disease. The majority of these results can be also stated in the language of percolation theory. The main contributions of the article are: (1) Extend to this setting some results which were previously known in the case when each individual has only one kind of interactions. (2) Find an explicit formula for the basic reproduction number $R_0$ which depends only on the probabilities of transmitting the disease along the different edges and the first two moments of the degree distributions of the associated graphs. (3) Motivated by the recent Covid-19 pandemic, we use the framework developed to compute the $R_0$ of a model disease spreading in populations whose trees and degree distributions are adjusted to several different countries. In this setting, we shall also compute the probability that the outbreak will not lead to an epidemic. In all cases we find such probability to be very low if no interventions are put in place.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. This allows the government to program the measures to loosen lockdown restrictions for the so called \"Phase 2\". Here we provided the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24th to April 24th, 2020 across two months into the epidemic. Our estimates suggest basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29, confirming that epidemiological figures of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Italy are higher than those observed at the early stage of Wuhan (China) outbreak. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to low the reproduction number under the unity (control regime). We estimated that among the worst hit regions in Italy, Lombardy reached the control regime on March 22nd followed by Emilia-Romagna (March 23th), Veneto (March 25th) and Piemonte (March 26th). Overall, we found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime in all the country is about 31 days from the February 24th and about 14 days from the first day of nationwide lockdown (March 12th). Finally, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two demographic indices in order to probe the \"state of activity\" of the epidemic for each Italian region in the control regime. We believe that this approach can provide a tool in the management of \"Phase 2\", potentially helping in challenging decision to continue, ease or tighten up restrictions.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

India has a high prevalence of VDD. We hypothesized that VDD as measured by serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) &amp;lt;20 ng/mL is associated with severe COVID-19 infection. Outcomes were assessed by the WHO ordinal scale for clinical improvement (OSCI)1, the need for oxygen therapy, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), and inflammatory markers. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was proven by RT-PCR on the nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV2. Serum 25OHD and PTH were measured in addition to the standard protocol for COVID-19. Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records and analyzed using SPSS v22.0. Patients with OSCI score &amp;lt;5 were classified as mild and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a55 as severe disease. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee. A total of 410 patients (127 females, 9 pediatric, 17 asymptomatic) were included with a median age of 54 years (6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015392 years) with 272(66.3%) having at least one co-morbid condition, including diabetes (190, 46.3%) and hypertension (164,40%). Patients with VDD (197,48%) were significantly younger (46.7\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b117.1 vs. 57.8\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b114.7 years) and had lesser prevalence of diabetes and hypertension (39.1% vs 52.4%, 29.4% vs 49.5%). Proportion of severe cases (26,13.2% vs. 31,14.6%), mortality (4, 2% vs. 11, 5.2%), oxygen requirement (68,34.5% vs.92,43.4), ICU admission (29, 14.7% vs. 42, 19.8%), need for inotropes (7,3.6% vs.12,5.7%) was not significantly different between patients with VDD and those with normal 25OHD level. The proportion of severe cases was similar across all 25OHD categories. There was no significant correlation between 25OHD levels and outcome OSCI, inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, D-dimer, ferritin, LDH). PTH levels positively correlated with D-dimer (r 0.117, p- 0.019), ferritin (r 0.132, p-0.010) and LDH (r0.124, p-0.018). Amongst VDD patients, 128(64.9%) were treated with cholecalciferol with a median dose of 60000 IU. The proportion of severe cases, oxygen, or ICU admission was not significantly different in the treated vs. untreated group. In conclusion, baseline levels of 25OHD did not determine the severe clinical outcomes of COVID-19 or levels of inflammatory markers.

Therefore, the need remains to understand how the virus is transmitted in order to identify high-risk environments and activities that disproportionately contribute to its spread so that effective preventative measures could be put in place. Contact tracing and household studies in particular provide robust evidence about the parameters of transmission. In this viewpoint, we discuss the available evidence from large-scale, well-conducted contact tracing studies from across the world and argue that SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics should inform policy decisions about mitigation strategies for targeted interventions according to the needs of the society by directing attention to the settings, activities and socioeconomic factors associated with the highest risks of transmission.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Compared to patients over 15 years old, the odds of dying were significantly lower in patients aged 5 to 15 and higher in children under five (with 100% mortality in those under 2 years old). The odds of dying increased by 11% per day that a patient was not hospitalised.

Established models for the epidemic spread such as compartmental epidemiological models e.g. Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) models and its variants, have been discussed extensively in the literature and utilized to forecast the growth of the pandemic across different hot-spots in the world. The standard formulations of SIR models rely upon summary-level data, which may not be able to fully capture the complete dynamics of the pandemic growth. Since the disease spreads from carriers to susceptible individuals via some form of contact, it inherently relies upon a network of individuals for its growth, with edges established via direct interaction, such as shared physical proximity. Using individual-level COVID-19 data from the early days (January 30 to April 15, 2020) of the pandemic in India, and under a network-based SIR model framework, we performed state-specific forecasting under multiple scenarios characterized by the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across 34 Indian states and union territories. We validated our short-term projections using observed case counts and the long-term projections using national sero-survey findings. Based on healthcare availability data, we also performed projections to assess the burdens on the infrastructure along the spectrum of the pandemic growth. We have developed an href{https://bayesrx.shinyapps.io/COV-N/}{interactive dashboard} summarizing our results. Our predictions successfully identified the initial hot-spots of India such as Maharashtra and Delhi, and those that emerged later, such as Madhya Pradesh and Kerala.

We implement an SEIR model to analyze the evolution of the disease in Buenos Aires and neighbouring cities (RMBA) with 15 million inhabitants. The parameters of the model are calibrated by using as data the number of casualties officially reported. Since infinite solutions honour the data, we show a set of cases by considering different situations. The first set of parameters yields initially a reproduction ratio R0 = 3.33 decreasing to 0.95 in April 8, after the lockdown, but increasing to 1.55 after April 27, most probably due to an increase of the contagion in highly populated slums. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 1.88 % and the predicted number of casualties is 173000 deaths with 9 million people infected at the end of the epidemic. However, keeping $R_0$ = 0.95 after April 27, would cause only 1881 casualties and 92955 infected individuals. Other cases, assuming the present trend, predict smaller incubation periods (4-5 days) and yield between 20000 and 70000 deaths and IFRs between 0.5 % and 1.1 %. We also consider doubling the number of casualties, with a death toll of 44000 individuals and 5.1 million infected individuals.

METHODS: We undertook a scoping review of COVID-19, comprehensively searching databases and other sources to identify literature on COVID-19 between 1 December 2019 and 6 February 2020. We analysed the sources, publication date, type and topic of the retrieved articles/studies. RESULTS: We included 249 articles in this scoping review. More than half (59.0%) were conducted in China. Guidance/guidelines and consensuses statements (n = 56; 22.5%) were the most common. Most (n = 192; 77.1%) articles were published in peer-reviewed journals, 35 (14.1%) on preprint servers and 22 (8.8%) posted online.

According to the Tg calculated in this paper, the R(0) of COVID-19 in Ningbo was 3.06 (95%CI: 2.64 - 3.51); according to the reported case transmission interval of 7.5 days in the literature, the R(0) was 3.32 (95%CI: 2.51-9.38 ). Conclusion: There is no age and gender specific differences in the Tg of clusters of COVID-19 cases in Ningbo, and COVID-19 has high infectivity and spreading power in early phase.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods We collected demographic and epidemiological information of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hefei and Shenzhen between January 19 and February 11, 2020, from data officially published by the provincial and municipal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). From these data we calculated basic reproduction number R0 to reflect the rate of spread of COVID-19 in these cities. Aggregated data of population migration during the same period was extracted from Baidu Migration. The change of R0 in the two cites were analyzed and compared. Spearman correlation analysis between R0 and population inflow from epidemic focus were performed. Results A total of 157 confirmed cases was identified in Hefei by 24:00 February 11, 2020, with an average age of 44.4\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b115.6 years, 74 female (47.1%) and 386 confirmed cases were identified in Shenzhen, with an average age of 45.15\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b117.99 years, 202 female (52.3%). Significant difference in the proportion of imported cases between the two cities was observed (Hefei vs Shenzhen, 24.2% vs 74.9%, p=0.000). Before January 31 2020, during the initial stage of the Level 1 Response to Major Public Health Emergencies, there was no significant association observed in Shenzhen between R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P =0.260, r=-0.452); meanwhile in Hefei, such association was strong (P =0.000, r=1.0). However, after the initial stage of response, the situation reversed. A weak association was observed in Shenzhen between be R0 and the proportion of population inflow from the epidemic focus (P=0.073, r=0.536) but not in Hefei (P =0.498, r=0.217). Conclusion Following Level 1 Response, consistent decline of R0 of COVID-19 was observed in both Hefei and Shenzhen. Different patterns of disease spread were observed in the two cities, driven by different patterns of population migration. This indicated that population migration should be taken into consideration when we set controlling policy of a novel infectious disease.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

While numerous predictive studies were published during the 2016\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 Zika Virus (ZIKV) pandemic, it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was. METHODS: To improve the functional use of mathematical modeling in support of future infectious disease outbreaks, we conducted a systematic review of all ZIKV prediction studies published during the recent ZIKV pandemic using the PRISMA guidelines. Using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and grey literature review, we identified studies that forecasted, predicted, or simulated ecological or epidemiological phenomena related to the Zika pandemic that were published as of March 01, 2017. Eligible studies underwent evaluation of objectives, data sources, methods, timeliness, reproducibility, accessibility, and clarity by independent reviewers. RESULTS: 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met the eligibility criteria. Spatial spread, R(0) (basic reproductive number), and epidemic dynamics were most commonly predicted, with few studies predicting Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a9 Syndrome burden (4%), sexual transmission risk (4%), and intervention impact (4%). Most studies specifically examined populations in the Americas (52%), with few African-specific studies (4%). Case count (67%), vector (41%), and demographic data (37%) were the most common data sources. Real-time internet data and pathogen genomic information were used in 7% and 0% of studies, respectively, and social science and behavioral data were typically absent in modeling efforts. Deterministic models were favored over stochastic approaches. Forty percent of studies made model data entirely available, 29% provided all relevant model code, 43% presented uncertainty in all predictions, and 54% provided sufficient methodological detail to allow complete reproducibility. Fifty-one percent of predictions were published after the epidemic peak in the Americas. While the use of preprints improved the accessibility of ZIKV predictions by a median of 119 days sooner than journal publication dates, they were used in only 30% of studies. CONCLUSIONS: Many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532017 pandemic. The accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied and indicates there is substantial room for improvement. To enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data, code, and preprints for future outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

They were used during the first French COVID-19 lockdown to estimate the reproduction numbers and predict the number of hospital beds required. This study aimed to assess the ability of similar compartmental models to reflect equivalent epidemic dynamics. Methods: The study considered three compartmental models independently designed to describe the COVID-19 outbreak in France. These models were scrutinized and their compartments and parameters expressed in a common framework. The parameters were set alike in the three models according to values taken from the literature. The models were calibrated using a common maximum likelihood function and the same hospitalization data taken from two official public databases. The calibration procedure was repeated over three different periods to compare model abilities to (1) fit over the whole lockdown; (2) predict the course of the epidemic during the lockdown; and, (3) provide a set of profiles to forecast the hospitalization prevalence after the lockdown. The study considered national and regional coverages. Results: The three models were all flexible enough to match hospitalization data during the lockdown, but the numbers of cases in the other compartments differed. The three models failed to predict reliably the number of hospitalizations after the fitting periods at national and regional levels. At the national scale, a refined calibration led to epidemic course profiles that reflected hospitalizations dynamics and corresponded to reproduction numbers coherent with official and literature estimates. This result could not be consistently obtained at the regional scale. Conclusion: Not all predictions were consistent between models. Even over the period used for calibration by fitting to hospitalization cases, important differences remained regarding the prevalence in the other compartments. Prevalence data are needed to further constrain the calibration and perform selection between still divergent models. This underlines strongly the need for repeated prevalence studies on representative samples, stratified by age and regions, which would undergo virological or serological tests.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, preparing oxide nano-springs is a challenge for their intrinsic lack of elasticity. Here, we developed an approach for preparing self-assembled, epitaxial, ferroelectric nano-springs with built-in strain due to the lattice mismatch in freestanding La0.7 Sr0.3 MnO3 /BaTiO3 (LSMO/BTO) bilayer heterostructures. We find that these LSMO/BTO nano-springs can be extensively pulled or pushed up to their geometry limits back and forth without breaking, exhibiting super-scalability with full recovery capability. The phase-field simulations reveal that the excellent scalability originates from the continuous ferroelastic domain structures, resulting from twisting under co-existing axial and shear strains. In addition, the oxide hetero-structural springs exhibit strong resilience due to the limited plastic deformation nature and the built-in strain between the bilayers. This discovery provides an alternative way for preparing and operating functional oxide nano-springs that can be applied to various technologies. This article is protected by copyright.

This study presents a new deterministic model for assessing the population-level impact of the quarantine of individuals suspected of being exposed to disease on the spread of the 2014\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 outbreaks of Ebola viral disease. It is assumed that quarantine is imperfect (i.e., individuals can acquire infection during quarantine). In the absence of quarantine, the model is shown to exhibit global dynamics with respect to the disease-free and its unique endemic equilibrium when a certain epidemiological threshold (denoted by [Formula: see text]) is either less than or greater than unity. Thus, unlike the full model with imperfect quarantine (which is known to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation), the version of the model with no quarantine does not undergo a backward bifurcation. Using data relevant to the 2014\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 Ebola transmission dynamics in the three West African countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), uncertainty analysis of the model show that, although the current level and effectiveness of quarantine can lead to significant reduction in disease burden, they fail to bring the associated quarantine reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) to a value less than unity (which is needed to make effective disease control or elimination feasible). This reduction of [Formula: see text] is, however, very possible with a modest increase in quarantine rate and effectiveness. It is further shown, via sensitivity analysis, that the parameters related to the effectiveness of quarantine (namely the parameter associated with the reduction in infectiousness of infected quarantined individuals and the contact rate during quarantine) are the main drivers of the disease transmission dynamics. Overall, this study shows that the singular implementation of a quarantine intervention strategy can lead to the effective control or elimination of Ebola viral disease in a community if its coverage and effectiveness levels are high enough.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This study examines the joint and mediating role of diabetes and weight in COVID-19 severity and mortality in a large sample of patients treated in a large urban hospital located in Southern California.Methods: A retrospective observational cohort study of patients who tested positive for COVID-19 between March 8, 2020 and January 25, 2021 was implemented. Participants were patients with a diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection who received care within the Cedars-Sinai Health System in Los Angeles, CA.

Univariable and multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify associated risk factors, and a regression causal mediation analysis examined the role of diabetes in the association between obesity and illness severity. All analyses were stratified by age (<65 and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a565).Findings: Among individuals younger than 65yo, diabetes accounted for 19-30% of the associations between obesity and COVID-19 illness severity. In both age groups, those with both obesity and diabetes had the highest odds of increased disease severity. Among patients 65yo and older, being underweight (BMI <18.5) was a risk factor for mortality regardless of diabetes history.Interpretation: Our findings have clinical implications in documenting which patients may be at elevated risk for hospitalization and adverse outcomes.

Belarus is a rare case of a country with a relatively modern healthcare system, where highly limited NPIs have been enacted. Thus, investigation of Belarusian COVID-19 dynamics is essential for the local and global assessment of the impact of NPI strategies. METHODS: We integrate genomic epidemiology and surveillance methods to investigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Belarus in 2020. We utilize phylodynamics, phylogeography, and probabilistic bias inference to study the virus import and export routes, the dynamics of the effective reproduction number, and the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. RESULTS: Here we show that the estimated cumulative number of infections by June 2020 exceeds the confirmed case number by a factor of ~4 (95% confidence interval (2; 9)). Intra-country SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity originates from at least 18 introductions from different regions, with a high proportion of regional transmissions. Phylodynamic analysis indicates a moderate reduction of the effective reproductive number after the introduction of limited NPIs, but its magnitude is lower than for developed countries with large-scale NPIs. On the other hand, the effective reproduction number estimate is comparable with that for the neighboring Ukraine, where NPIs were broader. CONCLUSIONS: The example of Belarus demonstrates how countries with relatively low outward population mobility continue to be integral parts of the global epidemiological environment. Comparison of the effective reproduction number dynamics for Belarus and other countries reveals the effect of different NPI strategies but also emphasizes the role of regional Eastern European sociodemographic factors in the virus spread.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Estimating the impact of mobility patterns on COVID-19 infection rates in 11 European countries\nBACKGROUND: As governments across Europe have issued non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as social distancing and school closing, the mobility patterns in these countries have changed. Most states have implemented similar NPIs at similar time points. However, it is likely different countries and populations respond differently to the NPIs and that these differences cause mobility patterns and thereby the epidemic development to change. METHODS: We build a Bayesian model that estimates the number of deaths on a given day dependent on changes in the basic reproductive number, R(0), due to differences in mobility patterns. We utilise mobility data from Google mobility reports using five different categories: retail and recreation, grocery and pharmacy, transit stations, workplace and residential. The importance of each mobility category for predicting changes in R(0) is estimated through the model. FINDINGS: The changes in mobility have a considerable overlap with the introduction of governmental NPIs, highlighting the importance of government action for population behavioural change. The shift in mobility in all categories shows high correlations with the death rates 1 month later. Reduction of movement within the grocery and pharmacy sector is estimated to account for most of the decrease in R(0). INTERPRETATION: Our model predicts 3-week epidemic forecasts, using real-time observations of changes in mobility patterns, which can provide governments with direct feedback on the effects of their NPIs. The model predicts the changes in a majority of the countries accurately but overestimates the impact of NPIs in Sweden and Denmark and underestimates them in France and Belgium. We also note that the exponential nature of all epidemiological models based on the basic reproductive number, R(0) cause small errors to have extensive effects on the predicted outcome.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The success of control of COVID-19 outbreak started from Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province of China relies heavily on the resilience of residents to follow public health interventions which induce substantial interruption of social-economic activities, and evidence shows that opinion leaders have been playing significant roles in the propagation of epidemic information and public health policy and implementations. METHODS: We design a mathematical model to quantify the roles of information superspreaders in single specific information which outbreaks rapidly and usually has a short duration period, and to examine the information propagation dynamics in the Chinese Sina-microblog. Our opinion-leader susceptible-forwarding-immune (OL-SFI) model is formulated to track the temporal evolution of forwarding quantities generated by opinion leaders and normal users. RESULTS: Data fitting from the real data of COVID-19 obtained from Chinese Sina-microblog can identify the different contact rates and forwarding probabilities (and hence calculate the basic information forwarding reproduction number of superspreaders), and can be used to evaluate the roles of opinion leaders in different stages of the information propagation and the outbreak unfolding.

All medical facilities in the city reported all patients who had positive rapid antigen tests for influenza A. When the epidemic exploded in late October, case-based surveillance for influenza-like illness (ILI) was implemented from November 3, 2009 until the end of the epidemic. A total of 7,781 influenza cases were reported between July 25 and November 2, 2009, with a cumulative incidence rate of 22.5 per 1,000 population. Nearly 70% of the patients were under 15 years old. Between November 3, 2009 and the end of March 2010, a total of 16,394 ILI cases were reported, with a cumulative incidence rate of 47.4 per 1,000 population. Of the ILI cases reported, 63% were in patients younger than 15 years old. Only one death with laboratory confirmation of the H1N1 2009 virus was reported during the epidemic. The age-specific reproduction number among children under 15 years of age was almost 1.40, whereas between children and adults (15 years of age and above) it was considerably less than 1.0.

                "prompt": "Risk Assessment of Importation and Local Transmission of COVID-19 in South Korea: Statistical Modeling Approach\nBACKGROUND: Despite recent achievements in vaccines, antiviral drugs, and medical infrastructure, the emergence of COVID-19 has posed a serious threat to humans worldwide. Most countries are well connected on a global scale, making it nearly impossible to implement perfect and prompt mitigation strategies for infectious disease outbreaks. In particular, due to the explosive growth of international travel, the complex network of human mobility enabled the rapid spread of COVID-19 globally. OBJECTIVE: South Korea was one of the earliest countries to be affected by COVID-19. In the absence of vaccines and treatments, South Korea has implemented and maintained stringent interventions, such as large-scale epidemiological investigations, rapid diagnosis, social distancing, and prompt clinical classification of severely ill patients with appropriate medical measures. In particular, South Korea has implemented effective airport screenings and quarantine measures. In this study, we aimed to assess the country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 and investigate its impact on the local transmission of COVID-19. METHODS: The country-specific importation risk of COVID-19 in South Korea was assessed. We investigated the relationships between country-specific imported cases, passenger numbers, and the severity of country-specific COVID-19 prevalence from January to October 2020. We assessed the country-specific risk by incorporating country-specific information. A renewal mathematical model was employed, considering both imported and local cases of COVID-19 in South Korea. Furthermore, we estimated the basic and effective reproduction numbers. RESULTS: The risk of importation from China was highest between January and February 2020, while that from North America (the United States and Canada) was high from April to October 2020. The R0 was estimated at 1.87 (95% CI 1.47-2.34), using the rate of &#945;=0.07 for secondary transmission caused by imported cases. The Rt was estimated in South Korea and in both Seoul and Gyeonggi. CONCLUSIONS: A statistical model accounting for imported and locally transmitted cases was employed to estimate R0 and Rt. Our results indicated that the prompt implementation of airport screening measures (contact tracing with case isolation and quarantine) successfully reduced local transmission caused by imported cases despite passengers arriving from high-risk countries throughout the year. Moreover, various mitigation interventions, including social distancing and travel restrictions within South Korea, have been effectively implemented to reduce the spread of local cases in South Korea.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Among these, lockdown policies proved unavoidable yet extremely costly from an economic perspective. To better understand the tradeoffs between economic and epidemic costs of lockdown interventions, we here focus on a simple SIR epidemic model and study lockdowns as solutions to an optimal control problem. We first show numerically that the optimal lockdown policy exhibits a phase transition from suppression to mitigation as the time horizon grows, i.e., if the horizon is short the optimal strategy is to impose severe lockdown to avoid diffusion of the infection, whereas if the horizon is long the optimal control steers the system to herd immunity to reduce economic loss. We then consider two alternative policies, motivated by government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, where lockdown levels are selected to either stabilize the reproduction number (i.e.,\"flatten the curve\") or the fraction of infected (i.e., containing the number of hospitalizations). We compute analytically the performance of these two feedback policies and compare them to the optimal control. Interestingly, we show that in the limit of infinite horizon stabilizing the number of infected is preferable to controlling the reproduction number, and in fact yields close to optimal performance.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The proposed approach employs an ensemble of deep neural networks to infer the time-dependent reproduction number of an infectious disease by formulating a tensor-based multi-step loss function that allows us to efficiently calibrate the model on multiple observed trajectories. The method is applied to a mobility and social behavior-based SEIR model of COVID-19 spread. The model is trained on Google and Unacast mobility data spanning a period of 66 days, and is able to yield accurate future forecasts of COVID-19 spread in 203 US counties within a time-window of 15 days. Strikingly, a sensitivity analysis that assesses the importance of different mobility and social behavior parameters reveals that attendance of close places, including workplaces, residential, and retail and recreational locations, has the largest impact on the basic reproduction number. The model enables us to rapidly probe and quantify the effects of government interventions, such as lock-down and re-opening strategies. Taken together, the proposed framework provides a robust workflow for data-driven epidemiology model discovery under uncertainty and produces probabilistic forecasts for the evolution of a pandemic that can judiciously inform policy and decision making.

However, an important question arises about the strategies of release of isolated persons to avoid overloaded hospitals and increased deaths. Sao Paulo State (Brazil) implemented the isolation of the population in non- essential activities on March 24, and the progressive flexibilization considering the characteristics of each location (release of the isolated population) initiated on June 15. A mathematical model based on the natural history of covid-19 was applied to describe the epidemiological scenario with isolation in Sao Paulo State, and assess the impact of release on the covid-19 epidemic. Using data collected from Sao Paulo State, we estimated the model parameters to obtain the curves of the epidemic, the number of deaths, and the clinical evolution of covid-19. The epidemic under isolation was the framework to evaluate the strategies of the release, that is, how these curves are changed with the release of isolated persons. We evaluated three strategies of release. First two strategies considered four releases in the isolated population in four equal proportions, but successive releases elapsed by 14 and 21 days. In each strategy the beginning of the release was on June 29 and July 13, when the effective reproduction number Ref was evaluated. The third strategy aimed at the protection of the elder subpopulation. We observed that the delay to begin the release and the increased elapse between successive releases resulted in a better scenario by decreasing severe covid-19 cases and, consequently, to avoid overloaded hospitals. We also observed that the release delayed to achieve lower values for Ref and infectious persons retarded in several months the quick increasing phase of the forthcoming epidemic. However, this epidemic can be flattened or even suppressed by isolation of infectious persons by mass testing and/or by rigid adoption of protective measures and social distancing.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Early prediction of SARS-CoV-2 reproductive number from environmental, atmospheric and mobility data: A supervised machine learning approach\nINTRODUCTION: SARS-CoV-2 was declared a pandemic by the WHO on March 11th, 2020. Public protective measures were enforced in every country to limit the diffusion of SARS-CoV-2. Its transmission, mainly by droplets, has been measured by the effective reproduction number (Rt) that counts the number of secondary cases caused in a population by an average infectious individual at time t. Current strategies to calculate Rt reflect the number of secondary cases after several days, due to a delay from symptoms onset to reporting. We propose a complementary Rt estimation using supervised machine learning techniques to predict short term variations with more timely results. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Our primary goal was to predict Rt of the current day in the twelve provinces of Lombardy with the highest possible accuracy, and with no influence of the local testing strategies. We gathered data about mobility, weather, and pollution from different public sources as a proxy of human behavior and public health measures. We built four supervised machine learning algorithms with different strategies: the outcome variable was the daily median Rt values per province obtained from officially adopted algorithms. RESULTS: Data from 243 days for every province were presented to our four models (from February 15th, 2020, to October 14th, 2020). Two models using differential calculation of Rt instead of the raw values showed the highest mean coefficient of determination (0.93 for both) and residuals reported the lowest mean error (-0.03 and 0.01) and standard deviation (0.13 for both) as well. The one with access to the value of Rt of the day before heavily relied on that feature for prediction, while the other one had more distributed weights. DISCUSSION: The model that had not access to the Rt value of the previous day and used Rt differential value as outcome (FDRt) was considered the most robust according to the metrics. Its forecasts were able to predict the trend that Rt values would have developed over different weeks, but it was not particularly accurate in predicting the precise value of Rt. A correlation among mobility, atmospheric, features, pollution and Rt values is plausible, but further testing should be performed.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Vaccination and non-pharmaceutical interventions for COVID-19: a mathematical modelling study\nBACKGROUND: The dynamics of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 are complicated by age-dependent factors, changing levels of infection, and the relaxation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as the perceived risk declines, necessitating the use of mathematical models. Our aims were to use epidemiological data from the UK together with estimates of vaccine efficacy to predict the possible long-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 under the planned vaccine rollout. METHODS: In this study, we used a mathematical model structured by age and UK region, fitted to a range of epidemiological data in the UK, which incorporated the planned rollout of a two-dose vaccination programme (doses 12 weeks apart, protection onset 14 days after vaccination). We assumed default vaccine uptake of 95% in those aged 80 years and older, 85% in those aged 50-79 years, and 75% in those aged 18-49 years, and then varied uptake optimistically and pessimistically. Vaccine efficacy against symptomatic disease was assumed to be 88% on the basis of Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines being administered in the UK, and protection against infection was varied from 0% to 85%. We considered the combined interaction of the UK vaccination programme with multiple potential future relaxations (or removals) of NPIs, to predict the reproduction number (R) and pattern of daily deaths and hospital admissions due to COVID-19 from January, 2021, to January, 2024. FINDINGS: We estimate that vaccination alone is insufficient to contain the outbreak. In the absence of NPIs, even with our most optimistic assumption that the vaccine will prevent 85% of infections, we estimate R to be 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b758 (95% credible intervals [CI] 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b736-1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b784) once all eligible adults have been offered both doses of the vaccine. Under the default uptake scenario, removal of all NPIs once the vaccination programme is complete is predicted to lead to 21 400 deaths (95% CI 1400-55 100) due to COVID-19 for a vaccine that prevents 85% of infections, although this number increases to 96 700 deaths (51 800-173 200) if the vaccine only prevents 60% of infections. Although vaccination substantially reduces total deaths, it only provides partial protection for the individual; we estimate that, for the default uptake scenario and 60% protection against infection, 48\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b73% (95% CI 48\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71-48\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b75) and 16\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70% (15\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b77-16\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b73) of deaths will be in individuals who have received one or two doses of the vaccine, respectively. INTERPRETATION: For all vaccination scenarios we investigated, our predictions highlight the risks associated with early or rapid relaxation of NPIs. Although novel vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 offer a potential exit strategy for the pandemic, success is highly contingent on the precise vaccine properties and population uptake, both of which need to be carefully monitored.

The answer depends on the basic reproductive number, R 0 , a key epidemiological parameter measuring the transmission capacity of a disease.

Understanding the pattern and the drivers of BTV-1 spread in Andalusia is critical for effective detection and control of future epidemics. A long-standing metric for quantifying the behaviour of infectious diseases is the case-reproduction ratio (R(t)), defined as the average number of secondary cases arising from a single infected case at time t (for t>0). Here we apply a method using epidemic trees to estimate the between-herd case reproduction ratio directly from epidemic data allowing the spatial and temporal variability in transmission to be described. We then relate this variability to predictors describing the hosts, vectors and the environment to better understand why the epidemic spread more quickly in some regions or periods. The R(t) value for the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia peaked in July at 4.6, at the start of the epidemic, then decreased to 2.2 by August, dropped below 1 by September (0.8), and by October it had decreased to 0.02. BTV spread was the consequence of both local transmission within established disease foci and BTV expansion to distant new areas (i.e. new foci), which resulted in a high variability in BTV transmission, not only among different areas, but particularly through time, which suggests that general control measures applied at broad spatial scales are unlikely to be effective. This high variability through time was probably due to the impact of temperature on BTV transmission, as evidenced by a reduction in the value of R(t) by 0.0041 for every unit increase (day) in the extrinsic incubation period (EIP), which is itself directly dependent on temperature. Moreover, within the range of values at which BTV-1 transmission occurred in Andalusia (20.6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C to 29.5\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C) there was a positive correlation between temperature and R(t) values, although the relationship was not linear, probably as a result of the complex relationship between temperature and the different parameters affecting BTV transmission. R(t) values for BTV-1 in Andalusia fell below the threshold of 1 when temperatures dropped below 21\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C, a much higher threshold than that reported in other BTV outbreaks, such as the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe. This divergence may be explained by differences in the adaptation to temperature of the main vectors of the BTV-1 epidemic in Andalusia (Culicoides imicola) compared those of the BTV-8 epidemic in Northern Europe (Culicoides obsoletus). Importantly, we found that BTV transmission (R(t) value) increased significantly in areas with higher densities of sheep. Our analysis also established that control of BTV-1 in Andalusia was complicated by the simultaneous establishment of several distant foci at the start of the epidemic, which may have been caused by several independent introductions of infected vectors from the North of Africa. We discuss the implications of these findings for BTV surveillance and control in this region of Europe.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We aim to predict the COVID-19 disease course and compare the effectiveness of mitigation measures across countries to inform policy decision making using a robust and parsimonious survival-convolution model. We account for transmission during a pre-symptomatic incubation period and use a time-varying effective reproduction number (R(t)) to reflect the temporal trend of transmission and change in response to a public health intervention. We estimate the intervention effect on reducing the transmission rate using a natural experiment design and quantify uncertainty by permutation. In China and South Korea, we predicted the entire disease epidemic using only early phase data (2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533 weeks after the outbreak). A fast rate of decline in R(t) was observed, and adopting mitigation strategies early in the epidemic was effective in reducing the transmission rate in these two countries. The nationwide lockdown in Italy did not accelerate the speed at which the transmission rate decreases. In the United States, R(t) significantly decreased during a 2-week period after the declaration of national emergency, but it declined at a much slower rate afterwards. If the trend continues after May 1, COVID-19 may be controlled by late July. However, a loss of temporal effect (e.g., due to relaxing mitigation measures after May 1) could lead to a long delay in controlling the epidemic (mid-November with fewer than 100 daily cases) and a total of more than 2 million cases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This study considered a simple deterministic SIR (Susceptible- Infectious-Recovered) model to characterize and predict future course of the pandemic in the West African countries. We estimated specific characteristics of the disease's dynamics such as its initial conditions, reproduction numbers, true peak, reported peak with their corresponding times, final epidemic size and time-varying attack ratio. Our findings revealed a relatively low proportion of susceptible individuals in the region and in the different countries (1.2% across West Africa). The detection rate of the disease was also relatively low (0.9% for West Africa as a whole) and < 2% for most countries, except for Cape-Verde (9.5%), Mauritania (5.9%) and Ghana (4.4%). The reproduction number varied between 1.15 (Burkina-Faso) and 4.45 (Niger) and the peak time of the pandemic was between June and July for most countries. Most generally, the reported peak time came a week (7-8 days) after the true peak time. The model predicted 222,100 actual active cases in the region at peak time while the final epidemic size accounted for 0.6% of the West African population (2,526,700 individuals). Results obtained showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has not severely affected West Africa as noticed in other regions of the world, but current control measures and standard operating procedures should be maintained over time to ensure trends observed and even accelerate the declining trend of the pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Unavailability of totally effective vaccination and proper treatment regimen forces to employ a non-pharmaceutical way of disease mitigation. The world is in desperate demand of useful control intervention to combat the deadly virus. This manuscript introduces a new mathematical model that addresses two different diagnosis efforts and isolation of confirmed cases. The basic reproductive number, R 0 , is inspected, and the model's dynamical characteristics are also studied. We found that with the condition R 0 < 1 , the disease can be eliminated from the system. Further, we fit our proposed model system with cumulative confirmed cases of six Indian states, namely, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Delhi and West Bengal. Sensitivity analysis carried out to scale the impact of different parameters in determining the size of the epidemic threshold of R 0 . It reveals that unidentified symptomatic cases result in an underestimation of R 0 whereas, diagnosis based on new contact made by confirmed cases can gradually reduce the size of R 0 and hence helps to mitigate the ongoing disease. An optimal control problem is framed using a control variable u ( t ) , projecting the effectiveness of diagnosis based on traced contacts made by a confirmed COVID patient. It is noticed that optimal contact tracing effort reduces R 0 effectively over time.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this epidemic, most countries impose severe intervention measures to contain the spread of COVID-19. The policymakers are forced to make difficult decisions to leverage between health and economic development. How and when to make clinical and public health decisions in an epidemic situation is a challenging question. The most appropriate solution is based on scientific evidence, which is mainly dependent on data and models. So one of the most critical problems during this crisis is whether we can develop reliable epidemiological models to forecast the evolution of the virus and estimate the effectiveness of various intervention measures and their impacts on the economy. There are numerous types of mathematical model for epidemiological diseases. In this paper, we present some critical reviews on mathematical models for the outbreak of COVID-19. Some elementary models are presented as an initial formulation for an epidemic. We give some basic concepts, notations, and foundation for epidemiological modelling.

Apart from forecasting the major turning points and parameters associated with the epidemic, we intend to provide an epidemiological assessment of the impact of these containment measures in India. Methods We propose a method based on time-series SIR model to estimate time-dependent modifiers for transmission rate of the infection. These modifiers are used in state-space SIR model to estimate reproduction number R0, expected total incidence, and to forecast the daily prevalence till the end of the epidemic. We consider four different scenarios, two based on current developments and two based on hypothetical situations for the purpose of comparison. Results Assuming gradual relaxation in lockdown post 17 May 2020, we expect the prevalence of infecteds to cross 9 million, with at least 1 million severe cases, around the end of October 2020. For the same case, estimates of R0 for the phases no-intervention, partial-lockdown and lockdown are 4.46 (7.1), 1.47 (2.33), and 0.817 (1.29) respectively, assuming 14-day (24-day) infectious period.

The asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission studies are still ongoing to assess their impacts on disease monitoring and burden. However, there has been limited research on how asymptomatic and symptomatic transmissions together can affect the coronavirus disease outbreak. A mathematical model is therefore needed to be developed in order to assess the effect of these transmissions on the coronavirus disease dynamics. This paper develops a mathematical model concerning asymptomatic and symptomatic disease transmission processes in the COVID-19 outbreak. The model sensitivity has been analysed in terms of the variance of each parameter, and the local stability at two equilibrium points have been discussed in terms of the basic reproduction number (R(0)). It is found that the disease-free equilibrium gets stable for R(0) < 1 whereas the endemic equilibrium becomes stable for R(0) > 1 and unstable otherwise. The proportion of the effect of asymptomatic and symptomatic transmission rates on R0 is calculated to be approximately between 1 and 3.

Because of recent implementation of effective contact tracing and isolation procedures, further MERS-CoV transmission data might no longer describe an entire cluster, but only secondary infections directly caused by the index patient. Hence, we calculated that, under scenario 2, eight or more secondary infections caused by the next index patient would translate into a 5% or higher chance that the revised MERS-CoV R(0) would exceed 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009die, that MERS-CoV might have pandemic potential. INTERPRETATION: Our analysis suggests that MERS-CoV does not yet have pandemic potential. We recommend enhanced surveillance, active contact tracing, and vigorous searches for the MERS-CoV animal hosts and transmission routes to human beings.

In this work, we have engineered multiserotype BTV vaccine candidates based on recombinant chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOx1) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vectors expressing the NS1 protein of BTV-4 or its truncated form NS1-Nt. A single dose of ChAdOx1-NS1 or ChAdOx1-NS1-Nt induced a moderate CD8+ T cell response and protected IFNAR(-/-) mice against a lethal dose of BTV-4/MOR09, a reassortant strain between BTV-1 and BTV-4, although the animals showed low viremia after infection. Furthermore, IFNAR(-/-) mice immunized with a single dose of ChAdOx1-NS1 were protected after challenge with a lethal dose of BTV-8 in absence of viremia nor clinical signs. Additionally, the heterologous prime-boost ChAdOx1/MVA expressing NS1 or NS1-Nt elicited a robust NS1 specific CD8+ T cell response and protected the animals against BTV-4/MOR09 even 16 weeks after immunization, with undetectable levels of viremia at any time after challenge. Subsequently, the best immunization strategy based on ChAdOx1/MVA-NS1 was assayed in sheep. Non-immunized animals presented fever and viremia levels up to 10(4) PFU/mL after infection. In contrast, although viremia was detected in immunized sheep, the level of virus in blood was 100 times lower than in non-immunized animals in absence of clinical signs.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: Outer (1,006,512 RT-PCR tests results for SARS-CoV-2) and proprietary (34,660 respiratory samples) epidemiological data was used. Fifteen European countries were studied. Dates of research: March 2 - May 22, 2020. RESULTS: As of April 21, 2020, the mean population infection rate (PIR) for the European countries considered, was 9.66%. It decreased to 6.85% by May 22, 2020. The model predicted 5.68% PIR, giving accuracy of 79.40%. SARS-CoV-2 basic reproduction number is limited by an extremum that may be observed for closed communities. A concept of effective reproduction number is introduced as a function of r0 with maximum at r0 = 4.671 and value reff. = 0.315 for the full-lockdown mode and r0 = 5.539 and reff. = 0.552 for the no-lockdown mode of SARS-CoV-2 containment. Full-lockdown and no-lockdown modes resulted in the outcomes not strikingly different from each other in terms of herd immunity values. CONCLUSION: In case of a second wave of COVID-19 disease in Europe, it will coincide with seasonal common cold surge, spanning from mid-September 2020 to mid-February 2021, with a median in November-December 2020. Strict epidemiological surveillance must be observed in Europe at that time.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Although 61,888 confirmed cases had been reported in Brazil by 28 April 2020, little was known about the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the country. To better understand the recent epidemic in the second most populous state in southeast Brazil (Minas Gerais, MG), we looked at existing epidemiological data from 3 states and sequenced 40 complete genomes from MG cases using Nanopore. We found evidence of multiple independent introductions from outside MG, both from genome analyses and the overly dispersed distribution of reported cases and deaths. Epidemiological estimates of the reproductive number using different data sources and theoretical assumptions all suggest a reduction in transmission potential since the first reported case, but potential for sustained transmission in the near future. The estimated date of introduction in Brazil was consistent with epidemiological data from the first case of a returning-traveler from Lombardia, Italy. These findings highlight the unique reality of MGs epidemic and reinforce the need for real-time and continued genomic surveillance strategies as a way of understanding and therefore preparing against the epidemic spread of emerging viral pathogens.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Slight reduction in SARS-CoV-2 exposure viral load due to masking results in a significant reduction in transmission with widespread implementation\nMasks are a vital tool for limiting SARS-CoV-2 spread in the population. Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by ~ 50%. Slight increases in mask adherence and/or efficacy above current levels would reduce the effective reproductive number (Re) substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks will also lower exposure viral load tenfold among people who get infected despite masking, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy would only lower Re if dosed as post-exposure prophylaxis and if given to ~ 50% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine. To confirm this prediction, we used a regression model of King County, Washington data and simulated the counterfactual scenario without mask wearing to estimate that in the absence of additional interventions, mask wearing decreased Re from 1.3-1.5 to ~ 1.0 between June and September 2020.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

It has a great impact on the infectious disease models and especially for covid-19 because in start the deterministic model played its role but with time due to uncertainty the stochastic model takes place and with long term expansion the use of fractional derivatives are required. The stability of the model is discussed regarding the reproductive number. Using the non-standard finite difference scheme for the numerical solution of the deterministic model and illustrate the obtained results graphically. Further, environmental noises are added to the model for the description of the stochastic model. Then take out the existence and uniqueness of positive solution with extinction for infection. Finally, we utilize a new technique of piecewise differential and integral operators for approximating Caputo-Fabrizio fractional derivative operator for the purpose of constructing of the fractional-order model. Then study the dynamics of the models such as positivity and boundedness of the solutions and local stability analysis.

                "prompt": "The Effectiveness of Contact Tracing in Emerging Epidemics\nBACKGROUND: Contact tracing plays an important role in the control of emerging infectious diseases, but little is known yet about its effectiveness. Here we deduce from a generic mathematical model how effectiveness of tracing relates to various aspects of time, such as the course of individual infectivity, the (variability in) time between infection and symptom-based detection, and delays in the tracing process. In addition, the possibility of iteratively tracing of yet asymptomatic infecteds is considered. With these insights we explain why contact tracing was and will be effective for control of smallpox and SARS, only partially effective for foot-and-mouth disease, and likely not effective for influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigate contact tracing in a model of an emerging epidemic that is flexible enough to use for most infections. We consider isolation of symptomatic infecteds as the basic scenario, and express effectiveness as the proportion of contacts that need to be traced for a reproduction ratio smaller than 1. We obtain general results for special cases, which are interpreted with respect to the likely success of tracing for influenza, smallpox, SARS, and foot-and-mouth disease epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) there is no general predictive formula for the proportion to be traced as there is for the proportion to be vaccinated; (2) variability in time to detection is favourable for effective tracing; (3) tracing effectiveness need not be sensitive to the duration of the latent period and tracing delays; (4) iterative tracing primarily improves effectiveness when single-step tracing is on the brink of being effective.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Studies reporting outcome data on patients with COVID-19 undergoing tracheostomy were identified and screened by 2 independent reviewers. Preferred Reporting Items or Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Outcome data were analysed using a random-effects model.

                "prompt": "Dynamic Panel Estimate-Based Health Surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Rates to Inform Public Health Policy: Model Development and Validation\nBACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, is a global pandemic with higher mortality and morbidity than any other virus in the last 100 years. Without public health surveillance, policy makers cannot know where and how the disease is accelerating, decelerating, and shifting. Unfortunately, existing models of COVID-19 contagion rely on parameters such as the basic reproduction number and use static statistical methods that do not capture all the relevant dynamics needed for surveillance. Existing surveillance methods use data that are subject to significant measurement error and other contaminants. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to provide a proof of concept of the creation of surveillance metrics that correct for measurement error and data contamination to determine when it is safe to ease pandemic restrictions. We applied state-of-the-art statistical modeling to existing internet data to derive the best available estimates of the state-level dynamics of COVID-19 infection in the United States. METHODS: Dynamic panel data (DPD) models were estimated with the Arellano-Bond estimator using the generalized method of moments. This statistical technique enables control of various deficiencies in a data set. The validity of the model and statistical technique was tested. RESULTS: A Wald chi-square test of the explanatory power of the statistical approach indicated that it is valid (&#967;210=1489.84, P<.001), and a Sargan chi-square test indicated that the model identification is valid (&#967;2946=935.52, P=.59). The 7-day persistence rate for the week of June 27 to July 3 was 0.5188 (P<.001), meaning that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 5188 cases 7 days later. For the week of July 4 to 10, the 7-day persistence rate increased by 0.2691 (P=.003), indicating that every 10,000 new cases in the prior week were associated with 7879 new cases 7 days later. Applied to the reported number of cases, these results indicate an increase of almost 100 additional new cases per day per state for the week of July 4-10. This signifies an increase in the reproduction parameter in the contagion models and corroborates the hypothesis that economic reopening without applying best public health practices is associated with a resurgence of the pandemic. CONCLUSIONS: DPD models successfully correct for measurement error and data contamination and are useful to derive surveillance metrics. The opening of America involves two certainties: the country will be COVID-19-free only when there is an effective vaccine, and the \"social\" end of the pandemic will occur before the \"medical\" end. Therefore, improved surveillance metrics are needed to inform leaders of how to open sections of the United States more safely. DPD models can inform this reopening in combination with the extraction of COVID-19 data from existing websites.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Several aspects cause regional heterogeneity in disease spread. Individual behaviour, mobility, viral variants and transmission vary locally, temporally and with season, and interventions and vaccination are often implemented regionally. Therefore, we developed a new regional changepoint stochastic SEIR metapopulation model. The model is informed by real-time mobility estimates from mobile phone data, laboratory-confirmed cases, and hospitalisation incidence. To estimate locally and time-varying transmissibility, case detection probabilities, and missed imported cases, we present a new sequential Approximate Bayesian Computation method allowing inference in useful time, despite the high parametric dimension. We test our approach on Norway and find that three-week-ahead predictions are precise and well-calibrated, suitable for real-time surveillance. SignificanceWe developed a regional infectious disease spread model focussing on operational usefulness in real time. The model is informed by near real-time mobile phone mobility data, laboratory-confirmed cases, and hospitalisation incidence. The model is used to estimate reproduction numbers and provide regional predictions of future hospital beds. Regional reproduction numbers are important due spatio-temporal heterogeneity due to for example local interventions. We assume different regional reproduction numbers for different periods of the epidemic. We propose a new calibration method to estimate the reproduction numbers and other parameters of the model, tailored to handle the increasingly high dimension of parameters over time. The model has been successfully used for local situational awareness and forecasting for the Norwegian health authorities during COVID-19.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Using information theory to optimise epidemic models for real-time prediction and estimation\nThe effective reproduction number, Rt, is a key time-varying prognostic for the growth rate of any infectious disease epidemic. Significant changes in Rt can forewarn about new transmissions within a population or predict the efficacy of interventions. Inferring Rt reliably and in real-time from observed time-series of infected (demographic) data is an important problem in population dynamics. The renewal or branching process model is a popular solution that has been applied to Ebola and Zika virus disease outbreaks, among others, and is currently being used to investigate the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This model estimates Rt using a heuristically chosen piecewise function. While this facilitates real-time detection of statistically significant Rt changes, inference is highly sensitive to the function choice. Improperly chosen piecewise models might ignore meaningful changes or over-interpret noise-induced ones, yet produce visually reasonable estimates. No principled piecewise selection scheme exists. We develop a practical yet rigorous scheme using the accumulated prediction error (APE) metric from information theory, which deems the model capable of describing the observed data using the fewest bits as most justified. We derive exact posterior prediction distributions for infected population size and integrate these within an APE framework to obtain an exact and reliable method for identifying the piecewise function best supported by available epidemic data. We find that this choice optimises short-term prediction accuracy and can rapidly detect salient fluctuations in Rt, and hence the infected population growth rate, in real-time over the course of an unfolding epidemic. Moreover, we emphasise the need for formal selection by exposing how common heuristic choices, which seem sensible, can be misleading. Our APE-based method is easily computed and broadly applicable to statistically similar models found in phylogenetics and macroevolution, for example. Our results explore the relationships among estimate precision, forecast reliability and model complexity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We divided the spread of COVID-19 in Japan into different stages based on policies. The effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the transmission parameters were determined to evaluate the measures conducted by the Japanese Government during these periods. On 7 April 2020, the Japanese authority declared a state of emergency to control the rapid development of the pandemic. Based on the simulation results, the spread of COVID-19 in Japan can be inhibited by containment actions during the state of emergency. The effective reproduction number [Formula: see text] reduced from 1.99 (before the state of emergency) to 0.92 (after the state of emergency). The transmission parameters were fitted and characterized with quantifiable variables including the ratio of untracked cases, the PCR test index and the proportion of COCOA app users (official contact confirming application). The impact of these variables on the control of COVID-19 was investigated in the modelling analysis. On 8 January 2021, the Japanese Government declared another state of emergency. The simulated results demonstrated that the spread could be controlled in May by keeping the same strategies. A higher intensity of PCR testing was suggested, and a larger proportion of COCOA app users should reduce the final number of infections and the time needed to control the spread of COVID-19.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This was performed to mimic the probable cumulative epidemic trajectories and predict future daily incidence by fitting the data to existing daily incidence and the estimated R0 by a model based on the assumption that daily incidence follows Poisson distribution. The maximum-likelihood (ML) value of R0 was 2.242 for COVID-19 outbreak, as on June 2020. The median with 95% CI of R0 values was 2.242 (1.50-3.00) estimated by bootstrap resampling method.

Assessing the associations between human behavior, infection, and social measures is essential to understand achievable reductions in cases and identify the factors driving changes in social dynamics. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between nighttime population volumes, the COVID-19 epidemic, and the implementation of public health and social measures in Tokyo. METHODS: We used mobile phone location data to estimate populations between 10 PM and midnight in seven Tokyo metropolitan areas. Mobile phone trajectories were used to distinguish and extract on-site dining from stay-at-work and stay-at-home behaviors. Numbers of new cases and symptom onsets were obtained. Weekly mobility and infection data from March 1 to November 14, 2020, were analyzed using a vector autoregression model. RESULTS: An increase in the number of symptom onsets was observed 1 week after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=0.60, 95% CI 0.28 to 0.92). The effective reproduction number significantly increased 3 weeks after the nighttime population volume increased (coefficient=1.30, 95% CI 0.72 to 1.89). The nighttime population volume increased significantly following reports of decreasing numbers of confirmed cases (coefficient=-0.44, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.15). Implementation of social measures to restaurants and bars was not significantly associated with nighttime population volume (coefficient=0.004, 95% CI -0.07 to 0.08). CONCLUSIONS: The nighttime population started to increase after decreasing incidence of COVID-19 was announced. Considering time lags between infection and behavior changes, social measures should be planned in advance of the surge of an epidemic, sufficiently informed by mobility data.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Specifically, it explores the interconnections between HAM and its effect on the early spread of the COVID-19 virus. During the early stages of the pandemic, effective reproduction numbers exhibited a high correlation with human mobility patterns, leading to a hypothesis that the HAM system can be studied as a coupled system with disease spread dynamics. This study applies the generalized Koopman framework with control inputs to determine the nonlinear disease spread dynamics and the input-output characteristics as a locally linear controlled dynamical system. The approach solely relies on the snapshots of spatiotemporal data and does not require any knowledge of the system's physical laws. We exploit the Koopman operator framework by utilizing the Hankel Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (HDMDc) algorithm to obtain a linear disease spread model incorporating human mobility as a control input. The study demonstrated that the proposed methodology could capture the impact of local mobility on the early dynamics of the ongoing global pandemic. The obtained locally linear model can accurately forecast the number of new infections for various prediction windows ranging from two to four weeks. The study corroborates a leader-follower relationship between mobility and disease spread dynamics. In addition, the effect of delay embedding in the HDMDc algorithm is also investigated and reported. A case study was performed using COVID infection data from Florida, US, and HAM data extracted from Google community mobility data report.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, the substantial economic and societal costs of continuous use of border controls, travel restrictions, and physical distancing measures suggest that these measures may not be sustainable and that policymakers have to seek strategies to lift the restrictions. Taiwan was one of the few countries that demonstrated initial success in eliminating the COVID-19 outbreak without strict lockdown or school closure. To understand the key contributors to the successful control, we applied a stochastic branching model to empirical case data to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of more targeted case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and less targeted population-based interventions (including social distancing and face mask use) in Taiwan. We found that case-based interventions alone would not be sufficient to contain the epidemic, even in a setting where a highly efficient contact tracing program was in place. The voluntary population-based interventions have reduced the reproduction numbers by more than 60% and have likely played a critical role at the early stage of the outbreak. Our analysis of Taiwan's success highlights that coordinated efforts from both the government and the citizens are indispensable in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is as important as detecting and treatment of infected individuals. Mathematical models play a crucial role in exploring the dynamics of the outbreak by deducing strategies paramount for curtailing the disease. The research extensively studies the SEQIAHR compartmental model of COVID-19 to provide insight into the dynamics of the disease by underlying tailored strategies designed to minimize the pandemic. We first studied the noncontrol model's dynamic behaviour by calculating the reproduction number and examining the two nonnegative equilibria' existence. The model utilizes the Castillo-Chavez method and Lyapunov function to investigate the global stability of the disease at the disease-free and endemic equilibrium. Sensitivity analysis was carried on to determine the impact of some parameters on R(0). We further examined the COVID model to determine the type of bifurcation that it exhibits. To help contain the spread of the disease, we formulated a new SEQIAHR compartmental optimal control model with time-dependent controls: personal protection and vaccination of the susceptible individuals. We solved it by utilizing Pontryagin's maximum principle after studying the dynamical behaviour of the noncontrol model. We solved the model numerically by considering different simulation controls' pairing and examined their effectiveness.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Here we use a data-driven model-inference approach to simulate the pandemic at county-scale in the United States during 2020 and estimate critical, time-varying epidemiological properties underpinning the dynamics of the virus. The pandemic in the US during 2020 was characterized by an overall ascertainment rate of 21.6% (95% credible interval (CI):18.9-25.5%). Population susceptibility at year end was 68.8% (63.4-75.3%), indicating roughly one third of the US population had been infected. Community infectious rates, the percentage of people harboring a contagious infection, rose above 0.8% (0.6-1.0%) before the end of the year, and were as high as 2.4% in some major metropolitan areas. In contrast, the infection fatality rate fell to 0.3% by year end; however, community control of transmission, estimated from trends of the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, slackened during successive pandemic waves. In the coming months, as vaccines are distributed and administered and new more transmissible virus variants emerge and spread, greater use of non-pharmaceutical interventions will be needed.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Our analyses suggest that the impact of measures reducing school-based contacts depends on the remaining opportunities to reduce non-school-based contacts. If opportunities to reduce the effective reproduction number (Re) with non-school-based measures are exhausted or undesired and Re is still close to 1, the additional benefit of school-based measures may be considerable, particularly among older school children. As two examples, we demonstrate that keeping schools closed after the summer holidays in 2020, in the absence of other measures, would not have prevented the second pandemic wave in autumn 2020 but closing schools in November 2020 could have reduced Re below 1, with unchanged non-school-based contacts.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The new disease has challenged policymakers and scientists on key issues such as the magnitude of the first-time problem, the susceptibility of the population, the severity of the disease, and its symptoms. Most countries have adopted lockdown policies to reduce the spatial spread of COVID-19, but they have damaged the economic and moral fabric of society. Timely action to prevent the spread of the virus is critical, and mathematical modeling in non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) policy management has proven to be a major weapon in this fight due to the lack of an effective COVID-19 vaccine. Methods: We present a new hybrid model for COVID-19 dynamics using both an age-structured mathematical model and spatio-temporal model in silico, analyzing the data of COVID-19 in Israel. The age-structured mathematical model is based on SIRD two age-class model. The spatial model examines a circle of day and night (with one-hour resolution) and three main locations (work / school or home) for every individual. Results: We determine mathematically the basic reproduction number ( R_0 ) via the next-generation matrix based on Markov chain theory. Then, we analyze the stability of the equilibria and the effects of the significant differences in infection rates between children and adults. Using the hybrid model, we have introduced a method for estimating the reproduction number of an epidemic in real time from the data of daily notification of cases. The results of the proposed model are confirmed by the Israeli Lockdown experience with a mean square error of 0.205 over two weeks. The model was able to predict changes in ( R_0 ) by opening schools on September 1, 2020, resulting in ( R_0 ) = 2.2, which entailed a month quarantine of all areas of life. According to the model, by extending the school day to 9 hours, and assuming that children and adults go to school and work every day (except weekends), we get a significant reduction in ( R_0 ) of 1.45. Finally, model-based analytical-numerical results are obtained and displayed in graphical profiles. Conclusions: The use of mathematical models promises to reduce the uncertainty in the choice of Lockdown policies. Our unique use of contact details from 2 classes (children and adults), the interaction of populations depending on the time of day (the cycle of day and night), and several physical locations, allowed a new look at the differential dynamics of the spread and control of infection. Using knowledge about how the length of the work and school day affects the dynamics of the spread of the disease can be useful for improving control programs, mitigation, and policy.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

An epidemiological model describing the spatial dynamics of disease transmission is presented. The effects of an ambient airflow, as an infection control, are incorporated leading to a delay equation, with droplet density dependent on the infectious density at a previous time. It is found that small droplets ([Formula: see text]) generate a negligible infectious force due to the small viral load and the associated duration they require to transmit infection. In contrast, larger droplets ([Formula: see text]) can lead to an infectious wave propagating through a fully susceptible population or a secondary infection outbreak for a localized susceptible population. Droplet diffusion is found to be an inefficient mode of droplet transport leading to minimal spatial spread of infection. A threshold air velocity is derived, above which disease transmission is impaired even when the basic reproduction number R(0) exceeds unity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Unfortunately, vital measures to control COVID-19 have had the negative trade-off of jeopardizing these rabies elimination and prevention activities. We aimed to assess the effect of interrupting canine rabies surveillance and mass dog vaccination campaigns on rabies trends. We built a deterministic compartment model of dog rabies dynamics to create a conceptual framework for how different disruptions may affect rabies virus transmission. We parameterized the model for conditions found in Arequipa, Peru, a city with active rabies virus transmission. We examined our results over a range of plausible values for R0 (1.36-2.0). Also, we prospectively evaluated surveillance data during the pandemic to detect temporal changes. Our model suggests that a decrease in canine vaccination coverage as well as decreased surveillance could lead to a sharp rise in canine rabies within months. These results were consistent over all plausible values of R0. Surveillance data from late 2020 and early 2021 confirms that in Arequipa, Peru, rabies cases are on an increasing trajectory. The rising rabies trends in Arequipa, if indicative to the region as whole, suggest that the achievements made in Latin America towards the elimination of dog-mediated human rabies may be in jeopardy.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. Since the end of May, the estimated reproduction number has a median value larger than one, although with a wide dispersion.

Understanding the early transmission dynamics of the infection and evaluating the effectiveness of control measures is crucial for assessing the potential for sustained transmission to occur in new areas. Combining a mathematical model of severe SARS-CoV-2 transmission with four datasets from within and outside Wuhan, we estimated how transmission in Wuhan varied between December, 2019, and February, 2020. We used these estimates to assess the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission to occur in locations outside Wuhan if cases were introduced. METHODS: We combined a stochastic transmission model with data on cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Wuhan and international cases that originated in Wuhan to estimate how transmission had varied over time during January, 2020, and February, 2020. Based on these estimates, we then calculated the probability that newly introduced cases might generate outbreaks in other areas. To estimate the early dynamics of transmission in Wuhan, we fitted a stochastic transmission dynamic model to multiple publicly available datasets on cases in Wuhan and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. The four datasets we fitted to were: daily number of new internationally exported cases (or lack thereof), by date of onset, as of Jan 26, 2020; daily number of new cases in Wuhan with no market exposure, by date of onset, between Dec 1, 2019, and Jan 1, 2020; daily number of new cases in China, by date of onset, between Dec 29, 2019, and Jan 23, 2020; and proportion of infected passengers on evacuation flights between Jan 29, 2020, and Feb 4, 2020. We used an additional two datasets for comparison with model outputs: daily number of new exported cases from Wuhan (or lack thereof) in countries with high connectivity to Wuhan (ie, top 20 most at-risk countries), by date of confirmation, as of Feb 10, 2020; and data on new confirmed cases reported in Wuhan between Jan 16, 2020, and Feb 11, 2020.

Based on our estimates of Rt, assuming SARS-like variation, we calculated that in locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan in early January, once there are at least four independently introduced cases, there is a more than 50% chance the infection will establish within that population. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID-19 transmission probably declined in Wuhan during late January, 2020, coinciding with the introduction of travel control measures. As more cases arrive in international locations with similar transmission potential to Wuhan before these control measures, it is likely many chains of transmission will fail to establish initially, but might lead to new outbreaks eventually.

Non-local fractional operators are one of the most efficient tools in order to understand the dynamics of the disease spread. For this purpose, we intend as an attempt at investigating the fractional COVID-19 model through Caputo operator with order &#967; &#8712; ( 0 , 1 ) . Employing the fixed point theorem, it is shown that the solutions of the proposed fractional model are determined to satisfy the existence and uniqueness conditions under the Caputo derivative. On the other hand, its iterative solutions are indicated by making use of the Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional operator. Also, we establish the stability criteria for the fractional COVID-19 model via the fixed point theorem. The invariant region in which all solutions of the fractional model under investigation are positive is determined as the non-negative hyperoctant R + 7 . Moreover, we perform the parameter estimation of the COVID-19 model by utilizing the non-linear least squares curve fitting method. The sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number R 0 c is carried out to determine the effects of the proposed fractional model's parameters on the spread of the disease.

The requirement of patients on dialysis for regular treatment in settings typically not conducive to social distancing may increase their vulnerability to COVID-19. METHODS: Over a 6-week period, we recorded new COVID-19 infections and outcomes for all adult patients receiving dialysis in a large dialysis center. Rapidly introduced control measures included a two-stage routine screening process at dialysis entry (temperature and symptom check, with possible cases segregated within the unit and tested for SARS-CoV-2), isolated dialysis in a separate unit for patients with infection, and universal precautions that included masks for dialysis nursing staff. RESULTS: Of 1530 patients (median age 66 years; 58.2% men) receiving dialysis, 300 (19.6%) developed COVID-19 infection, creating a large demand for isolated outpatient dialysis and inpatient beds. An analysis that included 1219 patients attending satellite dialysis clinics found that older age was a risk factor for infection. COVID-19 infection was substantially more likely to occur among patients on in-center dialysis compared with those dialyzing at home. We observed clustering in specific units and on specific shifts, with possible implications for aspects of service design, and high rates of nursing staff illness. A predictive epidemic model estimated a reproduction number of 2.2; cumulative cases deviated favorably from the model from the fourth week, suggesting that the implemented measures controlled transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The COVID-19 epidemic affected a large proportion of patients at this dialysis center, creating service pressures exacerbated by nursing staff illness.

We model this quarantine with a SEIR model including asymptomatic infections with differentiated shipboard roles for crew and passengers. The study includes the derivation of the basic reproduction number and simulation studies showing the effect of quarantine with COVID-19 or influenza on the total infection numbers. We show that quarantine on a ship with COVID-19 will lead to significant disease spread if asymptomatic infections are not identified. However, if the majority of the crew and passengers are immune or vaccinated to COVID-19, then quarantine would slow the spread.

We applied high-throughput genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 to 75% of cases in the State of Victoria (population 6.24 million) in Australia. METHODS: Cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection were detected through active case finding and contact tracing. A dedicated SARS-CoV-2 multidisciplinary genomic response team was formed to enable rapid integration of epidemiological and genomic data. Phylodynamic analysis was performed to assess the putative impact of social restrictions. RESULTS: Between 25 January and 14 April 2020, 1,333 COVID-19 cases were reported in Victoria, with a peak in late March. After applying internal quality control parameters, 903 samples were included in genomic analyses. Sequenced samples from Australia were representative of the global diversity of SARS-CoV-2, consistent with epidemiological findings of multiple importations and limited onward transmission. In total, 76 distinct genomic clusters were identified; these included large clusters associated with social venues, healthcare facilities and cruise ships. Sequencing of sequential samples from 98 patients revealed minimal intra-patient SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity. Phylodynamic modelling indicated a significant reduction in the effective viral reproductive number (Re) from 1.63 to 0.48 after the implementation of travel restrictions and population-level physical distancing. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide a comprehensive framework for the use of SARS-CoV-2 genomics in public health responses. The application of genomics to rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2 transmission chains will become critically important as social restrictions ease globally.

The highest number of MERS-CoV cases are from Saudi-Arabia, the major worldwide hotspot for this disease. In the absence of neither effective treatment nor a ready-to-use vaccine and with yet an incomplete understanding of its epidemiological cycle, prevention and containment measures can be derived from mathematical models of disease epidemiology. We constructed 2-strain models to predict past outbreaks in the interval 2012-2016 and derive key epidemiological information for Macca, Madina and Riyadh. We approached variability in infection through three different disease incidence functions capturing social behavior in response to an epidemic (e.g. Bilinear, BL; Non-monotone, NM; and Saturated, SAT models). The best model combination successfully anticipated the total number of MERS-CoV clinical cases for the 2015-2016 season and accurately predicted both the number of cases at the peak of seasonal incidence and the overall shape of the epidemic cycle. The evolution in the basic reproduction number (R0) warns that MERS-CoV may easily take an epidemic form. The best model correctly captures this feature, indicating a high epidemic risk (1&#8804;R0&#8804;2,5) in Riyadh and Macca and confirming the alleged co-circulation of more than one strain. Accurate predictions of the future MERS-CoV peak week, as well as the number of cases at the peak are now possible.

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm-to-farm reproductive number for HPAI. The reproductive number is a key measure of the transmissibility of HPAI at the farm level because it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. In these outbreaks the mean farm-to-farm reproductive number prior to controls ranged from 1.1 to 2.4, with the maximum farm-based reproductive number in the range 2.2 to 3.2. Enhanced bio-security, movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the reproductive number, but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs, current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease, and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required. The method we used for estimating the reproductive number is straightforward to implement and can be used in real-time.

Of the cases that have sought care thus far in the region, more than 70,000 have been reported out of Colombia. OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we use nontraditional digital disease surveillance data via HealthMap and Google Trends to develop near real-time estimates for the basic (R(0)) and observed (R(obs)) reproductive numbers associated with Zika virus disease in Colombia. We then validate our results against traditional health care-based disease surveillance data. METHODS: Cumulative reported case counts of Zika virus disease in Colombia were acquired via the HealthMap digital disease surveillance system. Linear smoothing was conducted to adjust the shape of the HealthMap cumulative case curve using Google search data. Traditional surveillance data on Zika virus disease were obtained from weekly Instituto Nacional de Salud (INS) epidemiological bulletin publications. The Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model was used to estimate R(0) and R(obs) for both data sources. RESULTS: Using the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data, we estimated a mean R(0) of 2.56 (range 1.42-3.83) and a mean R(obs) of 1.80 (range 1.42-2.30). The traditional (INS) data yielded a mean R(0) of 4.82 (range 2.34-8.32) and a mean R(obs) of 2.34 (range 1.60-3.31). CONCLUSIONS: Although modeling using the traditional (INS) data yielded higher R(0) estimates than the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data, modeled ranges for R(obs) were comparable across both data sources. As a result, the narrow range of possible case projections generated by the traditional (INS) data was largely encompassed by the wider range produced by the digital (smoothed HealthMap) data. Thus, in the absence of traditional surveillance data, digital surveillance data can yield similar estimates for key transmission parameters and should be utilized in other Zika virus-affected countries to assess outbreak dynamics in near real time.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this analogy, the three different populations of infection models correspond to three chemical species. Areal densities emerge as the key variables, thus capturing the effect of spatial density. We derive expressions for the kinetics of the infection rates and for the important parameter R0, that include areal density and its spatial distribution. Coupled with mobility the model allows the study of various effects. We first present results for a batch reactor, the chemical process equivalent of the SIR model. Because density makes R0 a decreasing function of the process extent, the infection curves are different and smaller than for the standard SIR model. We show that the effect of the initial conditions is limited to the onset of the epidemic. We derive effective infection curves for a number of cases, including a back-and-forth commute between regions of low and high R0 environments. We then consider spatially distributed systems. We show that diffusion leads to traveling waves, which in 1-D geometries propagate at a constant speed and with a constant shape, both of which are sole functions of R0. The infection curves are slightly different than for the batch problem, as diffusion mitigates the infection intensity, thus leading to an effective lower R0. The dimensional wave speed is found to be proportional to the product of the square root of the diffusivity and of an increasing function of R0, confirming the importance of restricting mobility in arresting the propagation of infection. We examine the interaction of infection waves under various conditions and scenarios, and extend the wave propagation analysis to 2-D heterogeneous systems.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Results suggest that mid-latitude atmospheric conditions are more favorable to COVID-19 transmission as compared to the tropical atmosphere.

The R(0) value further increased after 1 April 2020 over India, and the value of R(0) was found to be greater than 1, indicating that the epidemic was active. Moreover, the present study was also extended to understand the impact of global/Indian lockdowns on air quality and R(0) value for COVID-19 transmission. Our findings revealed that the global/Indian lockdown helped reduce the R(0) value of COVID-19 transmission, which is associated with atmospheric and air quality parameters.

We also project the epidemic curve considering realistic quarantine, social distancing, and possible medication scenarios. We use a deterministic epidemic model that includes asymptomatic, quarantined, isolated, and medicated population compartments for our analysis. We calculate the basic reproduction number R0 for the pre and post lockdown periods, noting that during this time, no medication was available. The pre-lock down the value of R0 is estimated to be 1.07, and the post lockdown value is estimated to be 1.86. We use this analysis to project the epidemic curve for a variety of lockdown, social distancing, and medication scenarios. We note that if no substantial efforts are made to contain the epidemic, it will peak in mid of September, with the maximum projected active cases being close to 700,000. In a realistic, best-case scenario, we project that the epidemic peaks in early to mid-July with the maximum active cases being around 120000.We note that social distancing measures and medication, if available, will help flatten the curve, however without the reintroduction of further lockdown, it would be very difficult to bring R0 below 1.

Using models applied to hospital and death data, we estimate the impact of the lockdown and current population immunity. We find that 2.9% of infected individuals are hospitalized and 0.5% of those infected die (95% credible interval: 0.3 to 0.9%), ranging from 0.001% in those under 20 years of age to 8.3% in those 80 years of age or older. Across all ages, men are more likely to be hospitalized, enter intensive care, and die than women. The lockdown reduced the reproductive number from 2.90 to 0.67 (77% reduction).

                "prompt": "The impact of COVID-19 control measures on social contacts and transmission in Kenyan informal settlements\nBACKGROUND: Many low- and middle-income countries have implemented control measures against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). However, it is not clear to what extent these measures explain the low numbers of recorded COVID-19 cases and deaths in Africa. One of the main aims of control measures is to reduce respiratory pathogen transmission through direct contact with others. In this study, we collect contact data from residents of informal settlements around Nairobi, Kenya, to assess if control measures have changed contact patterns, and estimate the impact of changes on the basic reproduction number (R(0)). METHODS: We conducted a social contact survey with 213 residents of five informal settlements around Nairobi in early May 2020, 4 weeks after the Kenyan government introduced enhanced physical distancing measures and a curfew between 7 pm and 5 am. Respondents were asked to report all direct physical and non-physical contacts made the previous day, alongside a questionnaire asking about the social and economic impact of COVID-19 and control measures. We examined contact patterns by demographic factors, including socioeconomic status. We described the impact of COVID-19 and control measures on income and food security. We compared contact patterns during control measures to patterns from non-pandemic periods to estimate the change in R(0). RESULTS: We estimate that control measures reduced physical contacts by 62% and non-physical contacts by either 63% or 67%, depending on the pre-COVID-19 comparison matrix used. Masks were worn by at least one person in 92% of contacts. Respondents in the poorest socioeconomic quintile reported 1.5 times more contacts than those in the richest. Eighty-six percent of respondents reported a total or partial loss of income due to COVID-19, and 74% reported eating less or skipping meals due to having too little money for food. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 control measures have had a large impact on direct contacts and therefore transmission, but have also caused considerable economic and food insecurity. Reductions in R(0) are consistent with the comparatively low epidemic growth in Kenya and other sub-Saharan African countries that implemented similar, early control measures. However, negative and inequitable impacts on economic and food security may mean control measures are not sustainable in the longer term.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This suggests that the country is at continuous risk. The epidemic level of MERS-CoV infection was examined in Saudi Arabia by the Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model using a Bayesian approach for estimation of time dependent reproduction number (R) across a two-year interval (May, 2013-May, 2015) in five defined clusters, followed by sensitivity analysis of the most significant clusters. Significant MERS-CoV peaks were detected in the period between March and May of each year. Moreover, MERS-CoV infection was highlighted in western (40.8%) and central (31.9%) regions, followed by eastern region (20%). The temporal-based Bayesian approach indicated a sub-critical epidemic in all regions in the baseline scenario (R: 0.85\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01530.97).

                "prompt": "Unveiling the real dynamics of transmission of COVID-19 in Malaysia without incarcerated clusters: a modelling study\nIntroduction: The latest outbreak of COVID-19 in Malaysia emerged in early September and had two determinants. First, it involved incarcerated populations from four prisons located in Sabah, Kedah and Penang states. Second, the Sabah state by-election campaigns accelerated the spread of COVID-19 in the state and across the South China Sea into the west Malaysia. The emergence of multiple incarcerated clusters at different time points may shadow the real dynamics of transmission of COVID-19 in the community and lead to inaccurate interpretation and conclusion. The study aimed to reveal the real spreading pattern of COVID-19 by excluding incarcerated clusters in the modelling. Method: ology: We extended the susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) model to include an additional class for non-isolated active cases, which was assumed to impel the transmission of COVID-19 in the community. The model was fitted to actual total and removed cases for estimation of duration of transmission and hospitalization. The parameters were then applied to model the transmission for COVID-19 in the community. Results: : The presence of incarcerated clusters shadowed the dynamics of transmission of COVID-19 with a lower reproduction number of 2.0. The proportion of non-isolated active cases increased slowly from 49.4% on 1 September 2020 to 60.3% on 8 October 2020. In the absence of incarcerated clusters, the dynamics of transmission of COVID-19 appeared differently with a higher reproduction number of 2.3. The proportion of non-isolated active cases increased tremendously from 22.1% on 1 September 2020 to 63.7% on 8 October 2020. The tremendous increase of non-isolated active cases impelled the dynamics of transmission of COVID-19 in the community following the Sabah state by-election campaigns and more inter-state travels. Conclusion: The inclusion of incarcerated clusters shadowed the dynamics of transmission of COVID-19 in the community with a lower transmission rate, which might lead to wrong interpretation of the dynamics of transmission in the community.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: The study population consisted of all the children and employees who attended the ECCC as well as household contacts of the confirmed COVID-19 cases. Of the 120 individuals in the study, five cases were confirmed by epidemiological link and 25 were identified as COVID-19 by RT-PCR among which 19 were analyzed by viral whole genome sequencing. Descriptive epidemiology, social network visualization, and phylogenetic analysis were used to characterize viral transmission. RESULTS: Phylogenetic analysis identified two separate introductions of distinct lineages of SARS-CoV-2 and estimated an average effective reproductive number of Re = 1.9 (range 0.9-4.9) with a mean doubling time of 3.2 days (range 2.1-5.2). The first and most prevalent lineage was introduced by two asymptomatic children who were likely infected by their parent, a confirmed COVID-19 case working in a long-term care centre. Among infected household adults, attack rates were significantly higher in mothers than in fathers (risk ratio = 4.5; 95% CI 1.1-18.7). The extent of transmission makes it one of the largest documented outbreaks in a daycare in Canada. CONCLUSION: The analyses carried out showed the probable origin and direction of the transmission of the infection (adult-child, child-adult, and child-child), thus highlighting how asymptomatic children can efficiently transmit SARS-CoV-2.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The strict enforcement of this curfew was extended through May 25, with a gradual relaxation beginning on May 1. This report summarizes an assessment of these early mitigation measures on the progression of COVID-19 in the island. Methods and Findings: From March 15 to May 15, 2020, 41,748 results of molecular (RT-PCR) tests were reported to the Puerto Rico Department of Health. Of these, 1,866 (4.5%) were positive, corresponding to 1,219 individuals with COVID-19 included in the study. We derived the epidemic growth rates (r) and the corresponding reproductive numbers (R) from the epidemic curve of these 1,219 individuals with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 using their date of test collection as a proxy for symptoms onset. We then compared the observed cases with the R-based epidemic model projections had the mitigation measures not been implemented. Computations were conducted in the R packages forecast, incidence and projections. The number of daily RT-PCR-confirmed cases peaked on March 30 (84 cases), showing a weekly cyclical trend, with lower counts on weekends and a decreasing secular trend since March 30. The initial exponential growth rate (r) was 17.0% (95% CI: 8.4%, 25.6%), corresponding to a doubling of cases every 4.1 days, and to a reproduction number (Ro) of 1.89 (95% CI: 1.41, 2.39). After March 30, the r value reverted to an exponential decay rate (negative) of -3.6% (95% CI: -5.7%, -1.4%), corresponding to a halving of cases every 19.4 days and to an Ro of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84, 0.97). Had the initial growth rate been maintained, a total of 18,699 (96%CI: 4,113, 87,438) COVID-19 cases would have occurred by April 30 compared with 1,119 observed. Conclusions: Our findings are consistent with very effective implementation of early non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) as mitigation measures in Puerto Rico.

With scarcity of Pediatric data from the Indian subcontinent, early observations in the pandemic are pivotal in improving the understanding of physiologic behaviors, identifying risks, and guiding clinicians in assessing time-tested interventions and augmenting the awareness in the masses about the manifold clinical profiles of an evolving disease. Objective: To assess the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of children admitted with COVID-19 infection early in the pandemic. Study Design: A cross-sectional study Participants: Fifty children between one month and 18 years of age whose nasopharyngeal swab tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT- PCR. Results: : 28 (56%) children were male. 41 (82%) came from government declared containment zones with only one child having history of travel to affected area. Home overcrowding was observed in 33 (66%). Of the 50 children, 29 (58%) were asymptomatic while 20 (40%) and one (2%) had mild and moderate symptoms respectively. Fever, cough, and sore throat were the most common symptoms. 49 (98%) children had BCG scar. Leucopenia was seen in three (6%) only. Mean (SD) Neutrophil-Lymphocyte-Ratio (NLR) was 0.78 (0.48) while mean (SD) CRP was 10.98 (23.90). All 50 (100%) were cured. Conclusion: Our study reasserts the increasing pediatric burden of COVID-19 with all age groups affected and overcrowding as a risk factor for continued community transmission, thus beckoning that public health policies be directed to ensuring further preventive measures.

                "prompt": "COVID-19 transmission in the U.S. before vs. after relaxation of social distancing measures\nBackground: All fifty U.S. states and the District of Columbia implemented social distancing measures that interrupted transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and reduced morbidity and mortality from coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All 51 jurisdictions have since begun to relax these measures, albeit in an uncoordinated fashion. Methods: We obtained state-level data on implementation and relaxation of social distancing measures. We fitted mixed-effects linear regression models with a random effect for state, specifying the time-varying, state-specific effective reproduction number (Rt, the expected number of secondary infections generated by each index case given date-specific population susceptibility and risk behavior). Explanatory variables included time in days, implementation period (1-21 days prior to first relaxation of any statewide social distancing measure vs. time from relaxation through May 28, 2020), and a time-by-period product term. Results: During the three weeks prior to relaxation, the estimated Rt was declining by an average of 0.0016 units per day (95% confidence interval [CI], -0.0025 to -0.0008). At the time of initial relaxation, states had reported a median 7,628 cases (range, 337-361,313) and 289 COVID-attributable deaths (range, 7-28,663), and the median estimated Rt was 1.0 (range, 0.8-1.3) (i.e., the median rate of epidemic growth across states was estimated to be zero). After the first relaxation of statewide social distancing measures, the estimated Rt began increasing by an average of 0.0047 units per day (95% CI, 0.0037 to 0.0058) compared with the pre-relaxation period. If these trends continue, the estimated state-level Rt would reach an average value of 1.05 (95% CI, 1.03-1.07) by 30 days after relaxation and 1.15 (95% CI, 1.11-1.18) by 60 days. A similar upward trajectory in the estimated Rt was observed after relaxation of statewide restrictions on internal movement. Conclusions: Relaxation of U.S. statewide social distancing measures was associated with a subsequent reversal of an earlier downward trend in transmission of SARS-CoV-2, particularly in states with less active epidemics at the time of relaxation.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Decision-making and planning is critical to ensure successful aging-in-place (AIP), especially when individuals experience age-related changes such as cognitive decline. Objectives: We are testing how decision-making and planning for AIP is impacted by changes in older adults' cognition and function, chronic conditions, social influences, environmental factors and identifying the mediating/moderating interactions between factors. We will also assess whether decision-making and planning for AIP translates into timely adoption of plans and goal concordance between older adults and their surrogate/caregiver decision makers. METHODS: We will conduct a longitudinal single-group interventional clinical trial of community-dwelling older adults who are enrolled in LitCog, (R01AG03611) and expose them to an online intervention, PlanYourLifespan.org, which facilitates decision-making and planning for AIP. Enrolled participants (n = 398) will complete interviews at baseline, one month, and every six months up to 42 months in conjunction with the LitCog study, where cognitive, social, functional, and health literacy data is collected. Additionally, we will collect data on decision-making, resource use, communication of plans, timing of plan implementation, and goal concordance. PROJECTED OUTCOMES: Findings from this study may generate evidence on how age-related changes in older adults may affect decision-making and implementation in relation to AIP as well as the impact of social relationships and support. Ultimately these findings may help shape the design of programs and practices that may improve the lives of older adults and the capacity of institutions to adapt to societal aging and AIP.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Numerical simulations show that strict suppression measures at the beginning of an epidemic can create low infectious numbers, which thereafter can be managed by mitigation measures over longer periods to flatten the epidemic curve. The stronger the suppression measure, the faster it achieves the low numbers of infections that are conducive to subsequent management.

It describes the average number of new infections caused by a single infectious person through time. To date, [Formula: see text] estimates are based on clinical data such as observed cases, hospitalizations, and/or deaths. These estimates are temporarily biased when clinical testing or reporting strategies change. OBJECTIVES: We show that the dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA in wastewater can be used to estimate [Formula: see text] in near real time, independent of clinical data and without the associated biases. METHODS: We collected longitudinal measurements of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater in Zurich, Switzerland, and San Jose, California, USA. We combined this data with information on the temporal dynamics of shedding (the shedding load distribution) to estimate a time series proportional to the daily COVID-19 infection incidence. We estimated a wastewater-based [Formula: see text] from this incidence. RESULTS: The method to estimate [Formula: see text] from wastewater worked robustly on data from two different countries and two wastewater matrices. The resulting estimates were as similar to the [Formula: see text] estimates from case report data as [Formula: see text] estimates based on observed cases, hospitalizations, and deaths are among each other. We further provide details on the effect of sampling frequency and the shedding load distribution on the ability to infer [Formula: see text]. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this is the first time [Formula: see text] has been estimated from wastewater. This method provides a low-cost, rapid, and independent way to inform SARS-CoV-2 monitoring during the ongoing pandemic and is applicable to future wastewater-based epidemiology targeting other pathogens. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10050\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Long, thin transmission chains of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 may go undetected for several weeks at low to moderate reproduction numbers: Implications for containment and elimination strategy\nSevere Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) infections almost always caused overt symptoms, so effective case and contact management enabled its effective eradication within months. However, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) usually causes only mild symptoms, so transmission chains may grow to include several individuals before at least one index case becomes ill enough to self-report for diagnosis and care. Here, simple mathematical models were developed to evaluate the implications of delayed index case detection for retrospective contact tracing and management responses. Specifically, these simulations illustrate how: (1) Contact tracing and management may effectively contain most but not all large SARS-CoV-2 clusters arising at foci with high reproduction numbers because rapidly expanding transmission chains ensure at least one overtly symptomatic index case occurs within two viral generations a week or less apart. (2) However, lower reproduction numbers give rise to thinner transmission chains extending through longer sequences of non-reporting asymptomatic and paucisymptomatic individuals, often spanning three or more viral generations (&#8805;2 weeks of transmission) before an overtly symptomatic index case occurs. (3) Consequently, it is not always possible to fully trace and contain such long, thin transmission chains, so the community transmission they give rise to is underrepresented in surveillance data. (4) Wherever surveillance systems are weak and/or transmission proceeds within population groups with lower rates of overt clinical symptoms and/or self-reporting, case and contact management effectiveness may be more severely limited, even at the higher reproduction numbers associated with larger outbreaks. (5) Because passive surveillance platforms may be especially slow to detect the thinner transmission chains that occur at low reproduction numbers, establishing satisfactory confidence of elimination may require that no confirmed cases are detected for two full months, throughout which presumptive preventative measures must be maintained to ensure complete collapse of undetected residual transmission. (6) Greater scope exists for overcoming these limitations by enhancing field surveillance for new suspected cases than by improving diagnostic test sensitivity. (7) While population-wide active surveillance may enable complete traceability and containment, this goal may also be achievable through enhanced passive surveillance for paucisymptomatic infections, combining readily accessible decentralized testing with population hypersensitization to self-reporting with mild symptoms. Containment and elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will rely far more upon presumptive, population-wide prevention measures than was necessary for SARS-CoV-1, necessitating greater ambition, political will, investment, public support, persistence and patience. Nevertheless, case and contact management may be invaluable for at least partially containing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, especially larger outbreaks, but only if enabled by sufficiently sensitive surveillance. Furthermore, consistently complete transmission chain containment may be enabled by focally enhanced surveillance around manageably small numbers of outbreaks in the end stages of successful elimination campaigns, so that their endpoints may be accelerated and sustained.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Individually optimal choices can be collectively disastrous in COVID-19 disease control\nBACKGROUND: The word 'pandemic' conjures dystopian images of bodies stacked in the streets and societies on the brink of collapse. Despite this frightening picture, denialism and noncompliance with public health measures are common in the historical record, for example during the 1918 Influenza pandemic or the 2015 Ebola epidemic. The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2-its high basic reproduction number (R0), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spread-exacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with interventions (such as vaccines and masks) to limit disease transmission. Our work explores the rationality and impact of noncompliance with measures aimed at limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals. We then used epidemiological modeling to predict the impact of noncompliance on control of SARS-CoV-2, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. RESULTS: Our modeling demonstrates that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions and that the existence of a noncompliant population can result in extensive endemic disease in the long-term after a return to pre-pandemic social and economic activity. Endemic disease poses a threat for both compliant and noncompliant individuals; all community members are protected if complete suppression is achieved, which is only possible with a high degree of compliance. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. CONCLUSIONS: In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering suppression of SARS-CoV-2 spread ineffective. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for prophylaxis through public health measures aimed at complete suppression and the need to focus on compliance at a population level.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, it is non-specific and could be increased in several cancers and some benign conditions. We report the case of a 70-year-old man followed since 2014 for a left colon adenocarcinoma with the persistence of an increased CEA. There was no evidence of recurrence, but a right lobar thyroid nodule without a significantly increased uptake was incidentally discovered on the CT scan of (18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose ((18)F-FDG) PET/CT. We suspected a medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) explaining the persistent elevation of CEA. Plasma calcitonin levels were 47 ng/L (N < 10). Fine needle aspiration cytology found atypia of undetermined significance and the patient was reluctant to undergo surgery without any further exploration. We performed a (18)F-fluorodihydroxyphenylalanine ((18)F-FDOPA) PET/CT preoperatively which revealed a punctiform focus of the right thyroid lobe corresponding to a pT1aN1aMxR0 medullary thyroid carcinoma, histopathologically confirmed.

The current source of the disease is mainly patients infected with SARS-COV-2. Patients in the incubation period may also become sources of infection. The virus is mainly transmitted via respiratory droplets and contact, and the population is generally susceptible. The epidemic has progressed through the local outbreak stage and community transmission stage due to exposure at Wuhan's Huanan wholesale seafood market and is now in the stage of large-scale transmission due to the spread of the epidemic. The basic productive number (R0) at the beginning of the epidemic was 2.2, with an average incubation period of 5.2 days. The proportion of critically ill patients was 23.4%, the mortality rate was lower than those of SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome, and 96.5% of deaths occurred in Hubei Province, where the outbreak occurred first.

Governments, decision-makers and policy-makers broadly need information about the effectiveness of a control intervention concerning its cost-benefit to evaluate whether a control intervention offers the best value for money. The outbreak of COVID-19 in December 2019, and the eventual spread to other parts of the world, have pushed governments and health authorities to take drastic socioeconomic, sociocultural and sociopolitical measures to curb the spread of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. To help policy-makers, health authorities and governments, we propose a Susceptible, Exposed, Asymptomatic, Quarantined asymptomatic, Severely infected, Hospitalized, Recovered, Recovered asymptomatic, Deceased, and Protective susceptible (individuals who observe health protocols) to describe the dynamics of COVID-19. We fit the model to real data from Ghana and Egypt to estimate model parameters using standard incidence rate. Projections for disease control and sensitivity analysis are presented using MATLAB. We noticed that multiple peaks (waves) of COVID-19 for Ghana and Egypt can be prevented if stringent health protocols are implemented for a long time and/or the reluctant behaviour on the use of protective equipment by individuals are minimized. The sensitivity analysis suggests that: the rate of diagnoses and testing, the rate of quarantine through doubling enhanced contact tracing, adhering to physical distancing, adhering to wearing of nose masks, sanitizing-washing hands, media education remains the most effective measures in reducing the control reproduction number R c , to less than unity in the absence of vaccines and therapeutic drugs in Ghana and Egypt. Optimal control and cost-effectiveness analysis are rigorously studied. The main finding is that having two controls (transmission reduction and case isolation) is better than having one control, but is economically expensive. In case only one control is affordable, then transmission reduction is better than case isolation.

Mobility statistics are a relatively new data source created by compiling smartphone location data; they can be effectively used for understanding pandemics if integrated with epidemiological findings and other economic data sets. Based on data for the first wave of infections in Japan, we found that reductions targeting the hospitality industry were slightly more effective than restrictions on general business activities. Specifically, we found that to hold back the pandemic (that is, to reduce the effective reproduction number to one or less for all days), a 20%-35% reduction in weekly mobility is required, depending on the region. A lesser goal, 80% of days with one or less observed transmission, can be achieved with a 6%-30% reduction in weekly mobility. These are the results if other potential causes of spread are ignored; for a fuller picture, more careful observations, expanded data sets, and advanced statistical modeling are needed.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, determining a pathogen\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s transmission dynamics is complicated by challenges often encountered in zoonotic disease surveillance, including unobserved sources of transmission (both human and zoonotic), limited spatial information, and unknown scope of surveillance. In this work, we present a model-based inference method that addresses these challenges for subcritical zoonotic pathogens using a spatial model with two levels of mixing. After demonstrating the robustness of the method using simulation studies, we apply the new method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program from 1982-1986 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Our results provide estimates of the reproductive number and spillover rate of monkeypox during this surveillance period and suggest that most human-to-human transmission events occur over distances of 30km or less. Taking advantage of contact-tracing data available for a subset of monkeypox cases, we find that around 80% of contact-traced links could be correctly recovered from transmission trees inferred using only date and location. Our results highlight the importance of identifying the appropriate spatial scale of transmission, and show how even imperfect spatiotemporal data can be incorporated into models to obtain reliable estimates of human-to-human transmission patterns. Surveillance datasets are often the only sources of information about the ecology and epidemiology of zoonotic infectious diseases. Methods that can extract as much information as possible from these datasets therefore provide a key advantage for informing our understanding of the disease dynamics and improving our ability to choose the optimal intervention strategy. We developed and tested a likelihood-based inference method based on a mechanistic model of the spillover and human-to-human transmission processes. We first used simulated datasets to explore which information about the disease dynamics of a subcritical zoonotic pathogen could be successfully extracted from a line-list surveillance dataset with non-localized spatial information and unknown geographic coverage. We then applied the method to a dataset of human monkeypox cases detected during an active surveillance program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo between 1982 and 1986 to obtain estimates of the reproductive number, spillover rate, and spatial dispersal of monkeypox in humans.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In Japan, 18,769 novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases have been reported as of June 30, 2020. This study aimed to assess whether cluster infection prevention is possible by evaluating the association between viral transmission and meteorological factors. METHODS: This study included 1263 people who were successively diagnosed with COVID-19 in Hokkaido, Japan between January 24, 2020 and June 30, 2020. After obtaining the values from the Japanese Meteorological Agency, the average scores of air temperature and humidity were calculated and compared with COVID-19 reproduction numbers, and the association between COVID-19 incidence or reproduction number and meteorological factors was assessed. RESULTS: The COVID-19 reproduction number in Hokkaido had three peaks that came several days before the surge in COVID-19 cases. The peaks are indicative of cluster infections. There was a strong negative correlation between the kinematic viscosity of atmospheric air and the reproduction number. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Analysis of the reproduction number is important for predicting or suppressing COVID-19 infection clusters. The authors found a strong association between meteorological factors, such as kinematic viscosity of atmospheric air and the incidence of COVID-19 infection. Meteorological forecasts could provide foreknowledge about COVID-19 infection clusters in the future.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The fast propagation of the disease combined with the existence of covert contagions by asymptomatic individuals make the controlling of this disease particularly challenging. The key parameter to track the progression of the epidemics is the effective reproduction number R, defined as the number of secondary infections generated by an infected individual[2]. The suppression of the epidemics is directly related to this value, and is attained when R<1.Here, we find an analytical expression for R as a function of mobility restrictions and confinement measures, using an epidemic model tailored for COVID-19. This expression for R is an extremely useful tool to design containment policies that are able to suppress the epidemics. We applied our epidemic model for the case of Spain, successfully forecasting both the observed incidence in each region and the overload of the health system. The expression for R allowed us to determine the precise reduction of mobility kappa_0 needed to bend the curve of epidemic incidence, which turned out to be kappa_0 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00cb\u2020 0.7.

                "prompt": "Successive waves of COVID 19: confinement effects on virus-prevalence with a mathematical model\nBACKGROUND: A pandemic outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (COVID 19) incidence data are largely available online. Until August 17, COVID 19 has hit more than 22 million individuals all over the globe. So, it is urged to get clear information about the prevalence of the virus. Therefore, one can manipulate easily a suitable mathematical model to fit these published data. METHODS: We propose a mathematical model that considers the total population, in 25 countries, either infected by COVID 19 or confined (safe) during the period from November 17, 2019, to August 17, 2020. The model considers the total population as a complex number; the imaginary part is the number of infected individuals and the real part is the number of confined individuals. This classification combined with mathematical treatments leads to a transmission dynamics of the virus to be as wave-like motion. The virus can hit any country either by one wave or by successive waves (up to 11 waves). FINDINGS: We find net discrimination between the 25 countries investigated in this report. The immediate response to the first attack is a substantial parameter to determine whether the epidemic attack will be in one wave or it can be in successive waves. For example, the best case was such as individuals in China hit by one wave while the individuals in the USA were attacked by nine waves; it is the worst case all over the globe. In addition, the model differentiates between the daily reproduction numbers (R(d0)) and the median reproduction number (R(0)). We have found that R(d0) decreases exponentially with time from high values down to zero at the wave maximum point; and R(0) varies from a country to another. For example, the virus hit individuals in Germany in R(0) = 1.39 (96% CI 1.01\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.87) and in the USA R(0) = 3.81 (91% CI 1.71\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01535.15). We have found that twice the virus has hit both the USA and Iran. The great protestation of black matter lives in the USA and the great assemblage of the new Iranian year, on March 21, 2020, have been the cause of the second epidemic attack in both countries. INTERPRETATION: Our results show that COVID 19 transmission depends on the prompt reaction against the first viral-wave. The reaction depends on both the social behaviour of individuals and on the swift system-decision by the governmental decision-maker(s). The Chinese strictly follow the decision-maker and therefore the virus hit by only one wave; while in the USA, the system-decision was different and the American-responses were different, therefore ten waves followed the first wave.

According to the Chinese government\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s immediate isolation and centralized diagnosis of confirmed cases, and the adoption of epidemic tracking measures on patients to prevent further spread of the epidemic, we divide the population into susceptible, exposed, infectious, quarantine, confirmed and recovered. This paper proposes an SEIR model with isolation measures that simultaneously investigates the infectivity of the incubation period, reflects prevention and control measures and calculates the basic reproduction number of the model. According to the data released by the National Health Commission of the People\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s Republic of China, we estimated the parameters of the model and compared the simulation results of the model with actual data. We have considered the trend of the epidemic under different incubation periods of infectious capacity. When the incubation period is not contagious, the peak number of confirmed in the model is 33,870; and when the infectious capacity is 0.1 times the infectious capacity in the infectious period, the peak number of confirmed in the model is 57,950; when the infectious capacity is doubled, the peak number of confirmed will reach 109,300. Moreover, by changing the contact rate in the model, we found that as the intensity of prevention and control measures increase, the peak of the epidemic will come earlier, and the peak number of confirmed will also be significantly reduced. Under extremely strict prevention and control measures, the peak number of confirmed cases has dropped by nearly 50%. In addition, we use the EEMD method to decompose the time series data of the epidemic, and then combine the LSTM model to predict the trend of the epidemic.

We model an individually randomized vaccine trial by generating a network of individuals and simulating an epidemic. The disease natural history follows a Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious and Symptomatic or Infectious and Asymptomatic, Recovered model. We then use seven approaches to estimate VES, and we also estimate vaccine efficacy against progression to symptoms (VEP). A corrected relative risk and an interval censored Cox model accurately estimate VES and only require serologic testing of participants once, while a Cox model using only symptomatic infections returns biased estimates. Only acquiring serological endpoints in a 10% sample and imputing the remaining infection statuses yields unbiased VES estimates across values of R0 and accurate estimates of VEP for higher values.

A resurgence in COVID-19 cases has been reported in some countries that lifted some of these NPIs. We aimed to understand the association of introducing and lifting NPIs with the level of transmission of SARS-CoV-2, as measured by the time-varying reproduction number (R), from a broad perspective across 131 countries. METHODS: In this modelling study, we linked data on daily country-level estimates of R from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (London, UK) with data on country-specific policies on NPIs from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker, available between Jan 1 and July 20, 2020. We defined a phase as a time period when all NPIs remained the same, and we divided the timeline of each country into individual phases based on the status of NPIs. We calculated the R ratio as the ratio between the daily R of each phase and the R from the last day of the previous phase (ie, before the NPI status changed) as a measure of the association between NPI status and transmission of SARS-CoV-2. We then modelled the R ratio using a log-linear regression with introduction and relaxation of each NPI as independent variables for each day of the first 28 days after the change in the corresponding NPI. In an ad-hoc analysis, we estimated the effect of reintroducing multiple NPIs with the greatest effects, and in the observed sequence, to tackle the possible resurgence of SARS-CoV-2. FINDINGS: 790 phases from 131 countries were included in the analysis. A decreasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the introduction of school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the reduction in R ranged from 3% to 24% on day 28 following the introduction compared with the last day before introduction, although the reduction was significant only for public events ban (R ratio 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b776, 95% CI 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b758-1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b700); for all other NPIs, the upper bound of the 95% CI was above 1. An increasing trend over time in the R ratio was found following the relaxation of school closure, bans on public events, bans on public gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits; the increase in R ranged from 11% to 25% on day 28 following the relaxation compared with the last day before relaxation, although the increase was significant only for school reopening (R ratio 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b724, 95% CI 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b700-1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b752) and lifting bans on public gatherings of more than ten people (1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b725, 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b703-1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b751); for all other NPIs, the lower bound of the 95% CI was below 1. It took a median of 8 days (IQR 6-9) following the introduction of an NPI to observe 60% of the maximum reduction in R and even longer (17 days [14-20]) following relaxation to observe 60% of the maximum increase in R. In response to a possible resurgence of COVID-19, a control strategy of banning public events and public gatherings of more than ten people was estimated to reduce R, with an R ratio of 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b771 (95% CI 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b755-0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b793) on day 28, decreasing to 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b762 (0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b747-0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b782) on day 28 if measures to close workplaces were added, 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b758 (0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b741-0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b781) if measures to close workplaces and internal movement restrictions were added, and 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b748 (0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b732-0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b771) if measures to close workplaces, internal movement restrictions, and requirements to stay at home were added. INTERPRETATION: Individual NPIs, including school closure, workplace closure, public events ban, ban on gatherings of more than ten people, requirements to stay at home, and internal movement limits, are associated with reduced transmission of SARS-CoV-2, but the effect of introducing and lifting these NPIs is delayed by 1-3 weeks, with this delay being longer when lifting NPIs. These findings provide additional evidence that can inform policy-maker decisions on the timing of introducing and lifting different NPIs, although R should be interpreted in the context of its known limitations.

Therefore, a new method for detecting CAM-resistant H. pylori using a minimally invasive technique is strongly desired. We aimed to investigate the clinical usefulness of our newly developed nested polymerase chain reaction-quenching probe (Nested PCR-QP) method using stool specimens. METHODS: We first evaluated our method using a residual solution of the H. pylori stool antigen test for adolescents. Then, we evaluated our method using culture testing for adults. RESULTS: Among 57 middle school students with H. pylori, the Nested PCR-QP test results of 53 (90.3%) were able to be analyzed. A total of 28 students had CAM resistance mutations. We found a genetic mutation in 28 students and no mutation in 23 students, and these results were consistent with those of PCR-direct sequencing. In the 23 adults who were diagnosed with H. pylori infection using the rapid urease test and culture testing, we were able to use Nested PCR-QP for analyzing 21 adults who tested positive in the stool H. pylori antigen test. The results obtained for all 21 adults were consistent with those obtained via the drug susceptibility test. CONCLUSIONS: Our novel method could be useful for non-invasively detecting CAM resistance mutations in H. pylori. This may help select a drug to reduce eradication failure rates against H. pylori.

The R0 values varies depending on social activity and type of gathering events that induce infection transmissibility, in addition to its pathophysiology dependence. Objectives In this study, we estimated the probable outbreak size of COVID-19 at clusters mathematically using a simple model that can predict the number of COVID-19 cases, as a function of time. Methods We proposed mathematical model to estimate the R0 of COVID-19 in the outbreak occurring in both of local and international clusters in light of published data.

With the aim to explore more about its aspects, we adopted the SEIQRD (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Quarantine-Recovered-Death) pandemic spread with a time delay on the heterogeneous population and geography in this work. Focusing on the spatial heterogeneity, the entire population of interest in a region is divided into small distinct geographical sub regions, which interact by means of migration networks across boundaries. Utilizing the estimations of the time delay differential equations based model, we analyzed the spread dynamics of disease in a region and its sub regions. The model based numerical outcomes are validated from real time available data for India. We computed the approximate peak infection in forward time and relative timespan when disease outspread halts. To further evaluate the influence of the delay on the long term system dynamics, the sensitivity analysis is performed on time delay. The most crucial parameter, basic reproduction number R0 and its time-dependent generalization, has been estimated at both regional and sub regional levels. The impact of the most significant lockdown measure that has been implemented in India to contain the pandemic spread has been extensively studied by considering no lockdown scenario.

R0 is used to determine the ability of a disease to spread within a given population. The reproduction number (R) represents the transmissibility of a disease. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to calculate the R0 of Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) in Sri Lanka and to describe the variation of R, with its implications to the prevention and control of the disease. METHODS: Data was obtained from daily situation reports of the Epidemiology Unit, Sri Lanka and a compartmental model was used to calculate the R0 using estimated model parameters. This value was corroborated by using two more methods, the exponential growth rate method and maximum likelihood method to obtain a better estimate for R0. The variation of R was illustrated using a Bayesian statistical inference-based method. RESULTS: The R0 calculated by the first model was 1.02 [confidence interval (CI) of 0.75-1.29] with a root mean squared error of 7.72. The exponential growth rate method and the maximum likelihood estimation method yielded an R0 of 0.93 (CI of 0.77-1.10) and a R0 of 1.23 (CI of 0.94-1.57) respectively.

Different modeling approaches have been proposed in an attempt to predict the behavior of these local cycles. OBJECTIVE: This paper presents a framework to characterize the different variables that drive the local, or epidemic, cycles of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to provide a set of relatively simple, yet efficient, statistical tools to be used by local health authorities to support decision making. METHODS: Virtually closed cycles were compared to cycles in progress from different locations that present similar patterns in the figures that describe them. With the aim to compare populations of different sizes at different periods of time and locations, the cycles were normalized, allowing an analysis based on the core behavior of the numerical series. A model for the reproduction number was derived from the experimental data, and its performance was presented, including the effect of subnotification (ie, underreporting). A variation of the logistic model was used together with an innovative inventory model to calculate the actual number of infected persons, analyze the incubation period, and determine the actual onset of local epidemic cycles. RESULTS: The similarities among cycles were demonstrated. A pattern between the cycles studied, which took on a triangular shape, was identified and used to make predictions about the duration of future cycles. Analyses on effective reproduction number (R(t)) and subnotification effects for Germany, Italy, and Sweden were presented to show the performance of the framework introduced here. After comparing data from the three countries, it was possible to determine the probable dates of the actual onset of the epidemic cycles for each country, the typical duration of the incubation period for the disease, and the total number of infected persons during each cycle. In general terms, a probable average incubation time of 5 days was found, and the method used here was able to estimate the end of the cycles up to 34 days in advance, while demonstrating that the impact of the subnotification level (ie, error) on the effective reproduction number was &lt;5%. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that, with relatively simple mathematical tools, it is possible to obtain a reliable understanding of the behavior of COVID-19 local epidemic cycles, by introducing an integrated framework for identifying cycle patterns and calculating the variables that drive it, namely: the R(t), the subnotification effects on estimations, the most probable actual cycles start dates, the total number of infected, and the most likely incubation period for SARS-CoV-2.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Conventional methods using reported incidence are unable to provide R t timely due to the delay from infection to reporting. Here, we aim to develop a framework to predict the R t in real-time using timely accessible data, i.e., human mobility, temperature, and risk awareness. Methods A linear regression model to predict R t was designed and embedded in the renewal process. Four prefectures of Japan with high incidence in the first wave were selected for model fitting and validation. Predictive performance was assessed by comparing the observed and predicted incidence using cross-validation, by testing on a separate dataset in two other prefectures with distinct geographical settings from the four prefectures. Results The predicted mean values of R t and 95% uncertainty intervals well traced the overall trend of incidence, while predictive performance was diminished when R t abruptly changed potentially due to superspreading events and when stringent countermeasures were implemented.

                "prompt": "The course of the UK COVID 19 pandemic; no measurable impact of new variants.\nIntroduction In November 2020, a new SARS-COV-2 variant or the Kent variant emerged in the UK, and became the dominant UK SARS-COV-2 variant, demonstrating faster transmission than the original variant, which rapidly died out. However, it is unknown if this actually altered the overall course of the pandemic as genomic analysis was not common place at the outset and other factors such as the climate could alter the viral transmission rate over time. We aimed to test the hypothesis that the overall observed viral transmission was not altered by the emergence of the new variant, by testing a model generated earlier in the pandemic based on lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity. Methods From 1/1/20 to 4/2/21, the daily incidence of SARS-COV-2 deaths and the overall stringency of National Lockdown policy on each day was extracted from the Oxford University Government response tracker. The daily average temperature and humidity for London was extracted from Wunderground.com. The viral reproductive rate was calculated on a daily basis from the daily mortality data for each day. The correlation between log10 of viral reproductive rate and lockdown stringency and weather parameters were compared by Pearson correlation to determine the time lag associated with the greatest correlation. A multivariate model for the log10 of viral reproductive rate was constructed using lockdown stringency, temperature and humidity for the period 1/1/20 to 30/9/20. This model was extrapolated forward from 1/10/20 to 4/2/21 and the predicted viral reproductive rate, daily mortality and cumulative mortality were compared with official data. Results On multivariate linear regression, the optimal model had and R2 0f 0.833 for prediction of log10 viral reproductive rate 13 days later in the model construction period, with (coefficient, probability) lockdown stringency (-0.0109, p=0.0000), humidity (0.0038, p=0.0041) and temperature (-0.0035, p=0.0008). When extrapolated to the validation period (1/10/20 to 4/2/21), the model was highly correlated with daily (Pearson coefficient 0.88, p=0.0000) and cumulated SARS-COV-2 mortality (Pearson coefficient 0.99, p=0.0000). Conclusion The course of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in the UK seems highly predicted by an earlier model based on the lockdown stringency, humidity and temperature and unaltered by the emergence of newer viral genotype.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Then, the control reproduction number of general population epidemic model is obtained. Based on the epidemic model of general population, the epidemic model of general population and college population is further established, and the control reproduction number is also obtained. METHODS: For the established epidemic model, firstly, the expression of the control reproduction number is obtained by using the next generation matrix. Secondly, the real-time reported data of COVID-19 in Shaanxi Province is used to fit the epidemic model, and the parameters in the model are estimated by least square method and MCMC. Thirdly, the Latin hypercube sampling method and partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) are adopted to analyze the sensitivity of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The control reproduction number remained at 3 from January 23 to January 31, then gradually decreased from 3 to slightly greater than 0.2 by using the real-time reports on the number of COVID-19 infected cases from Health Committee of Shaanxi Province in China. In order to further control the spread of the epidemic, the following measures can be taken: (i) reducing infection by wearing masks, paying attention to personal hygiene and limiting travel; (ii) improving isolation of suspected patients and treatment of symptomatic individuals. In particular, the epidemic model of the college population and the general population is established, and the control reproduction number is given, which will provide theoretical basis for the prevention and control of the epidemic in the colleges.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The generation interval and latent period, though both are of importance in understanding the features of COVID-19 transmission, are difficult to observe, and thus they can rarely be learnt from surveillance data empirically. In this study, we develop a likelihood framework to estimate the generation interval and incubation period simultaneously by using the contact tracing data of COVID-19 cases, and infer the pre-symptomatic transmission proportion and latent period thereafter. We estimate the mean of incubation period at 6.8 days (95 %CI: 6.2, 7.5) and SD at 4.1 days (95 %CI: 3.7, 4.8), and the mean of generation interval at 6.7 days (95 %CI: 5.4, 7.6) and SD at 1.8 days (95 %CI: 0.3, 3.8). The basic reproduction number is estimated ranging from 1.9 to 3.6, and there are 49.8 % (95 %CI: 33.3, 71.5) of the secondary COVID-19 infections likely due to pre-symptomatic transmission. Using the best estimates of model parameters, we further infer the mean latent period at 3.3 days (95 %CI: 0.2, 7.9).

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the 1-year outcomes of a social media\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153based and peer and clinician-supported smoking cessation program on Facebook and examine communication patterns that could support smoking cessation and identify risk of relapse. METHODS: We used a mixed methods case study evaluation approach featuring a single-case holistic design. We recruited volunteers who signed up after successful completion of a 12-week clinical smoking cessation program in a general medicine department in Japan. Participants contemporaneously accessed a closed Facebook page, and we analyzed their posts including text and emoticons. We used joint display analysis, which involved iterative structuring and restructuring construct-specific tables with both types of data to find the most effective approach for integrating the quantitative results with the qualitative results of content analysis. RESULTS: One successful participant and 2 relapsed participants were analyzed to explore the specific patterns of postings prior to relapse. Decisive comments about quitting smoking were common among participants, but encouraging messages for peers were more common from the successful participant. Comments seeking social support and reassurance were warning signs of relapse. Conflicted comments also may be a warning sign of relapse risk. CONCLUSIONS: These findings based on a mixed methods case study of a social media platform supporting smoking cessation could be used to guide messaging in other online social networking service communities after a smoking cessation program to help reduce smoking relapse.

                "prompt": "The global spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome: an analysis fusing traditional epidemiological tracing and molecular phylodynamics\nBACKGROUND: Since its discovery in 2012, over 1700 confirmed cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) have been documented worldwide and more than a third of those cases have died. While the greatest number of cases has occurred in Saudi Arabia, the recent export of MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) to Republic of Korea showed that a pandemic is a possibility that cannot be ignored. Due to the deficit of knowledge in transmission methodology, targeted treatment and possible vaccines, understanding this virus should be a priority. Our aim was to combine epidemiological data from literature with genetic information from viruses sequenced around the world to present a phylodynamic picture of MERS spread molecular level to global scale. METHODS: We performed a qualitative meta-analysis of all laboratory confirmed cases worldwide to date based on literature, with emphasis on international transmission and healthcare associated infections. In parallel, we used publicly available MERS-CoV genomes from GenBank to create a phylogeographic tree, detailing geospatial timeline of viral evolution. RESULTS: Several healthcare associated outbreaks starting with the retrospectively identified hospital outbreak in Jordan to the most recent outbreak in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia have occurred. MERS has also crossed many oceans, entering multiple nations in eight waves between 2012 and 2015. In this paper, the spatiotemporal history of MERS cases, as documented epidemiologically, was examined by Bayesian phylogenetic analysis. Distribution of sequences into geographic clusters and interleaving of MERS-CoV sequences from camels among those isolated from humans indicated that multiple zoonotic introductions occurred in endemic nations. We also report a summary of basic reproduction numbers for MERS-CoV in humans and camels. CONCLUSION: Together, these analyses can help us identify factors associated with viral evolution and spread as well as establish efficacy of infection control measures. The results are especially pertinent to countries without current MERS-CoV endemic, since their unfamiliarity makes them particularly susceptible to uncontrollable spread of a virus that may be imported by travelers.

                "prompt": "Uncertainty quantification in epidemiological models for the COVID-19 pandemic\nMathematical modeling of epidemiological diseases using differential equations are of great importance in order to recognize the characteristics of the diseases and their outbreak. The procedure of modeling consists of two essential components: the first component is to solve the mathematical model numerically, the so-called forward modeling. The second component is to identify the unknown parameter values in the model, which is known as inverse modeling and leads to identifying the epidemiological model more precisely. The main goal of this paper is to develop the forward and inverse modeling of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic using novel computational methodologies in order to accurately estimate and predict the pandemic. This leads to governmental decisions support in implementing effective protective measures and prevention of new outbreaks. To this end, we use the logistic equation and the SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) system of ordinary differential equations to model the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. For the inverse modeling, we propose Bayesian inversion techniques, which are robust and reliable approaches, in order to estimate the unknown parameters of the epidemiological models. We deploy an adaptive Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for the estimation of a posteriori probability distribution and confidence intervals for the unknown model parameters as well as for the reproduction number. We perform our analyses on the publicly available data for Austria to estimate the main epidemiological model parameters and to study the effectiveness of the protective measures by the Austrian government. The estimated parameters and the analysis of fatalities provide useful information for decision-makers and makes it possible to perform more realistic forecasts of future outbreaks. According to our Bayesian analysis for the logistic model, the growth rate and the carrying capacity are estimated respectively as 0.28 and 14974. Moreover for the parameters of the SIR model, namely the transmission rate and recovery rate, we estimate 0.36 and 0.06, respectively. Additionally, we obtained an average infectious period of 17 days and a transmission period of 3 days for COVID-19 in Austria. We also estimate the reproduction number over time for Austria. This quantity is estimated around 3 on March 26, when the first recovery was reported. Then it decays to 1 at the beginning of April. Furthermore, we present a fatality analysis for COVID-19 in Austria, which is also of importance for governmental protective decision-making. According to our analysis, the case fatality rate (CFR) is estimated as 4% and a prediction of the number of fatalities for the coming 10 days is also presented. Additionally, the ICU bed usage in Austria indicates that around 2% of the active infected individuals are critical cases and require ICU beds. Therefore, if Austrian governmental protective measures would not have taken place and for instance if the number of active infected cases would have been around five times larger, the ICU bed capacity could have been exceeded.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact behaviour from mid-April to the beginning of August, during different stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing the ratio of [Formula: see text] with respect to pre-pandemic data. During the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent across all age-classes.

Tracking case numbers over time allows us to determine speed of spread and the effectiveness of interventions. Changing case definitions during an epidemic can affect these inferences. MethodsWe examined changes in the case definition for COVID-19 in mainland China during the first epidemic wave. We used simple models assuming exponential growth and then exponential decay to estimate how changes in the case definitions affected the numbers of cases reported each day. We then inferred how the epidemic curve would have appeared if the same case definition had been used throughout the epidemic. FindingsFrom January through to early March 2020, seven versions of the case definition for COVID-19 were issued by the National Health Commission in China. As of February 20, there were 55,508 confirmed cases reported in mainland China. We estimated that when the case definitions were changed from version 1 to 2, version 2 to 4 and version 4 to 5, the proportion of infections being detected as cases were increased by 7.1-fold (95% credible interval (CI): 4.8, 10.9), 2.8-fold (95% CI: 1.9, 4.2) and 4.2-fold (95% CI: 2.6, 7.3) respectively. If the fifth version of the case definition had been applied throughout the outbreak, we estimated that by February 20 there would have been 232,000 (95% CI: 161,000, 359,000) confirmed cases. InterpretationThe case definition was initially narrow, but was gradually broadened to allow detection of more cases as knowledge increased, particularly milder cases and those without epidemiological links to Wuhan or other known cases. This should be taken into account when making inferences on epidemic growth rates and doubling times, and therefore on the reproductive number, to avoid bias.

The influence of such formulaic disease modelling has pervaded public health policy and practice during the Covid-19 pandemic. The critical vocabulary of epidemiology, and now popular debate, thus includes R0, the basic reproduction number of the virus, 'flattening the curve', and epidemic 'waves'. How did this happen? What are the consequences of framing and foreseeing the pandemic in these modes? Focusing on historical and contemporary disease responses, primarily in Britain, I explore the emergence of statistical modelling as a 'crisis technology', a reductive mechanism for making rapid decisions or judgments under uncertain biological constraint. I consider how Covid-19 might be configured or assembled otherwise, constituted as a more heterogeneous object of knowledge, a different and more encompassing moment of truth - not simply as a measured telos directing us to a new normal. Drawing on earlier critical engagements with the AIDS pandemic, inquiries into how to have 'theory' and 'promiscuity' in a crisis, I seek to open up a space for greater ecological, sociological, and cultural complexity in the biopolitics of modelling, thereby attempting to validate a role for critique in the Covid-19 crisis.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

For hospitalised patients, the daily infectivity was approximately 0.15 early in the epidemic, but fell to 0.0006 in the later part of the epidemic. Despite the lower daily infectivity level for hospitalised patients, the long duration of the hospitalisation led to a greater number of transmissions within hospitals compared with the community in the early part of the epidemic, as estimated by this study.

Respiratory viruses can be transmitted via four major modes of transmission: direct (physical) contact, indirect contact (fomite), (large) droplets and (fine) aerosols. We know little about the relative contribution of each mode to the transmission of a particular virus in different settings, and how its variation affects transmissibility and transmission dynamics. Discussion on the particle size threshold between droplets and aerosols and the importance of aerosol transmission for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza virus is ongoing. Mechanistic evidence supports the efficacies of non-pharmaceutical interventions with regard to virus reduction; however, more data are needed on their effectiveness in reducing transmission. Understanding the relative contribution of different modes to transmission is crucial to inform the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions in the population. Intervening against multiple modes of transmission should be more effective than acting on a single mode.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In the absence of efficient therapeutics or large-scale vaccination, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 707 governmental interventions published up to May 22, 2020, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. We analyze the effect of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states and population movement on the changes in the TR and effective reproduction number. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Although the recovery rate is greater than the death rate, the COVID-19 infection is becoming very harmful for the human community and causing financial loses to their economy. No proper vaccine for this infection has been introduced in the market in order to treat the infected people. Various approaches have been implemented recently to study the dynamics of this novel infection. Mathematical models are one of the effective tools in this regard to understand the transmission patterns of COVID-19. In the present paper, we formulate a fractional epidemic model in the Caputo sense with the consideration of quarantine, isolation, and environmental impacts to examine the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak. The fractional models are quite useful for understanding better the disease epidemics as well as capture the memory and nonlocality effects. First, we construct the model in ordinary differential equations and further consider the Caputo operator to formulate its fractional derivative. We present some of the necessary mathematical analysis for the fractional model. Furthermore, the model is fitted to the reported cases in Pakistan, one of the epicenters of COVID-19 in Asia. The estimated value of the important threshold parameter of the model, known as the basic reproduction number, is evaluated theoretically and numerically. Based on the real fitted parameters, we obtained [Formula: see text] . Finally, an efficient numerical scheme of Adams\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Moulton type is used in order to simulate the fractional model. The impact of some of the key model parameters on the disease dynamics and its elimination are shown graphically for various values of noninteger order of the Caputo derivative. We conclude that the use of fractional epidemic model provides a better understanding and biologically more insights about the disease dynamics.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

It is indeed a matter of serious concern to study the transmission dynamics of this virus. The potential and severity of an outbreak and providing critical information for identifying the type of disease interventions and intensity can be well understood by the unknown basic reproduction number. A stochastic model can be used to estimate this number with possible safeguard on uncertainties. It is essential to assess how the expensive, resource-intensive measures can contribute to the prevention and control of the 2019-nCoV infection and how long they should be maintained. A short-term forecast of incidences are often of high priority. The challenge is to forecast unseen future simulated data for three different scenarios at some time points. We estimate current levels of transmissibility, over variable time points under different levels of interventions and use that to forecast near-future incidence.

The underlying model incorporates the possible treatment measures as the emerging scenario of covid-19 vaccines. Keeping in view the fact that the real time data for covid-19 is updated at discrete time steps, we propose a new structure preserving numerical scheme for the proposed model. The proposed numerical scheme produces realistic solutions of the complex bi-modal SITR nonlinear model, converges unconditionally to steady states and reflects dynamical consistency with continuous sense of the model. The analysis of the model reveals that the model remains stable at the steady state points. The basic reproduction number Rcovid falls less than 1 when treatment rate is increased and disease will die out. On the other hand, it predicts that human population may face devastating effects of pandemic if the treatment measures are not strictly implemented.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

An exhaustive statistical analysis encompassing arithmetic, geometric, harmonic means, standard deviation, skewness, variance, Pearson and Spearman correlation was derived from the data collected from Turkey and South Africa within the period of 11 March 2020 to 3 May 2020 and 05 March and 3 of May respectively. It was observed that in the case of Turkey, a negative Spearman correlation for the number of infected class and a positive Spearman correlation for both the number of deaths and recoveries were obtained. This implied that the daily infections could decrease, while the daily deaths and number of recovered people could increase under current conditions. In the case of South Africa, a negative Spearman correlation for both daily deaths and daily infected people was obtained, indicating that these numbers may decrease if the current conditions are maintained. The utilization of a statistical technique predicted the daily number of infected, recovered and dead people for each country; and three results were obtained for Turkey, namely an upper boundary, a prediction from current situation and lower boundary. The prediction shows that Turkey may register in the near future approximately more than 6000 new infections in a day as worst case scenario; and less than 300 cases in the perfect scenario. However, the country could register in the near future a daily number of 27000 people recovered from COVID-19 in the perfect scenario; and less than 5000 people in a worst scenario. Moreover, Turkey in a worst-case scenario could record a high number of approximately 200 deaths per day; and less than 150 deaths in a perfect scenario. Similarly, in the case of South Africa, the prediction results show that in the near future the country could register about 500 new infected cases daily and more than 25 deaths in the worst scenario; while in a perfect scenario less than 50 new infected and zero death cases could be recorded. The histograms of the daily number of newly infected, recovered and death showed a sign of lognormal and normal distribution, which is presented using the Bell curving method parameters estimation. A new mathematical model COVID-19 comprised of nine classes was suggested; of which a formula of the reproductive number, well-poseness of the solutions and the stability analysis were presented in details. The suggested model was further extended to the scope of nonlocal operators for each case; whereby the Atangana-Seda numerical method was used to provide numerical solutions, and simulations were performed for different non-integer numbers. Additionally, sections devoted to control optimal and others dedicated to compare cases between Turkey and South Africa with the aim to comprehend why there are less numbers of deaths and infected people in South Africa than Turkey were presented in details.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The outbreaks started in India on March 2, 2020. As of April 30, 2020, 34,864 confirmed cases and 1,154 deaths are reported in India and more than 30,90,445 confirmed cases and 2,17,769 deaths are reported worldwide. Mathematical models may help to explore the transmission dynamics, prediction and control of COVID-19 in the absence of an appropriate medication or vaccine. In this study, we consider a mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission with the imperfect lockdown effect. The basic reproduction number, R(0), is calculated using the next generation matrix method. The system has a disease-free equilibrium (DFE) which is locally asymptotically stable whenever R(0) < 1. Moreover, the model exhibits the backward bifurcation phenomenon, where the stable DFE coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium when R(0) < 1. The epidemiological implications of this phenomenon is that the classical epidemiological requirement of making R(0) less than unity is only a necessary, but not sufficient for effectively controlling the spread of COVID-19 outbreak. It is observed that the system undergoes backward bifurcation which is a new observation for COVID-19 disease transmission model. We also noticed that under the perfect lockdown scenario, there is no possibility of having backward bifurcation. Using Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle Invariance Principle, the DFE is shown globally asymptotically stable for perfect lockdown model. We have calibrated our proposed model parameters to fit daily data from India, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina. We have provided a short-term prediction for India, Mexico, South Africa and Argentina of future cases of COVID-19. We calculate the basic reproduction number from the estimated parameters. We further assess the impact of lockdown during the outbreak.

SHERLOCK, or Specific High-Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing, is one such CRISPR-based diagnostic that combines recombinase polymerase pre-amplification, CRISPR-RNA base-pairing, and LwCas13a activity for nucleic acid detection. METHODS: We developed SHERLOCK assays capable of detecting all Plasmodium species known to cause human malaria and species-specific detection of P. vivax and P. falciparum, the species responsible for the majority of malaria cases worldwide. We further tested these assays using a diverse panel of clinical samples from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda, and Thailand and pools of Anopheles mosquitoes from Thailand. In addition, we developed a prototype SHERLOCK assay capable of detecting the dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) single nucleotide variant A581G associated with P. falciparum sulfadoxine resistance. FINDINGS: The suite of Plasmodium assays achieved analytical sensitivities ranging from 2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a25-18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a28 parasites per reaction when tested against laboratory strain genomic DNA. When compared to real-time PCR, the P. falciparum assay achieved 94% sensitivity and 94% specificity during testing of 123 clinical samples. Compared to amplicon-based deep sequencing, the dhps SHERLOCK assay achieved 73% sensitivity and 100% specificity when applied to a panel of 43 clinical samples, with false-negative calls only at lower parasite densities.

The number of cases and deaths rose exponentially, alongside a sharp increase in hospitalizations and intubated patients. The Thai Government then implemented a lockdown to mitigate the outbreak magnitude and prevent cases from overwhelming the healthcare system. This study aimed to model the severity of the outbreak over the following months by different levels of lockdown effectiveness. Secondary analysis was performed on data primarily obtained from the Ministry of Health; the data were analyzed using both the deterministic compartmental model and the system dynamics model. The model was calibrated against the number of daily cases in Greater Bangkok during June\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153July 2021. We then assessed the outcomes (daily cases, daily deaths, and intubated patients) according to hypothetical lockdowns of varying effectiveness and duration. The findings revealed that lockdown measures could reduce and delay the peak of COVID-19 cases and deaths. A two-month lockdown with 60% effectiveness in the reduction in reproduction number caused the lowest number of cases, deaths, and intubated patients, with a peak about one-fifth of the size of a no-lockdown peak. The two-month lockdown policy also delayed the peak until after December, while in the context of a one-month lockdown, cases peaked during the end of September to early December (depending on the varying degrees of lockdown effectiveness in the reduction in reproduction number). In other words, the implementation of a lockdown policy did not mean the end of the outbreak, but it helped delay the peak. In this sense, implementing a lockdown helped to buy time for the healthcare system to recover and better prepare for any future outbreaks. We recommend further studies that explore the impact of lockdown measures at a sub-provincial level, and examine the impact of lockdowns on parameters not directly related to the spread of disease, such as quality of life and economic implications for individuals and society.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Assessing the impact of such openings in relation to the risk of a resumption of the spread of the disease is an extremely difficult problem due to the many unknowns concerning the actual number of people infected, the actual reproduction number and infection fatality rate of the disease. In this work, starting from a compartmental model with a social structure and stochastic inputs, we derive models with multiple feedback controls depending on the social activities that allow to assess the impact of a selective relaxation of the containment measures in the presence of uncertain data.

In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antivirals, strategies for controlling and mitigating the burden of the pandemic are focused on non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing, contact-tracing, quarantine, isolation, and the use of face-masks in public. We develop a new mathematical model for assessing the population-level impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies. Rigorous analysis of the model shows that the disease-free equilibrium is locally-asymptotically stable if a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (denoted by \u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a2\u00c3\u201a\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00c3\u201a\u00e2\u20ac\u00bac), is less than unity. Simulations of the model, using data relevant to COVID-19 transmission dynamics in the US state of New York and the entire US, show that the pandemic burden will peak in mid and late April, respectively. The worst-case scenario projections for cumulative mortality (based on the baseline levels of anti-COVID non-pharmaceutical interventions considered in the study) decrease dramatically by 80% and 64%, respectively, if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are maintained until the end of May or June, 2020. The duration and timing of the relaxation or termination of the strict social-distancing measures are crucially-important in determining the future trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study shows that early termination of the strict social-distancing measures could trigger a devastating second wave with burden similar to those projected before the onset of the strict social-distancing measures were implemented. The use of efficacious face-masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy &#8805; 70%) in public could lead to the elimination of the pandemic if at least 70% of the residents of New York state use such masks in public consistently (nationwide, a compliance of at least 80% will be required using such masks). The use of low efficacy masks, such as cloth masks (of estimated efficacy less than 30%), could also lead to significant reduction of COVID-19 burden (albeit, they are not able to lead to elimination). Combining low efficacy masks with improved levels of the other anti-COVID-19 intervention strategies can lead to the elimination of the pandemic. This study emphasizes the important role social-distancing plays in curtailing the burden of COVID-19. Increases in the adherence level of social-distancing protocols result in dramatic reduction of the burden of the pandemic, and the timely implementation of social-distancing measures in numerous states of the US may have averted a catastrophic outcome with respect to the burden of COVID-19. Using face-masks in public (including the low efficacy cloth masks) is very useful in minimizing community transmission and burden of COVID-19, provided their coverage level is high. The masks coverage needed to eliminate COVID-19 decreases if the masks-based intervention is combined with the strict social-distancing strategy.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We analyze the dynamics of this system, compute the reproduction numbers, and use the data from the Cuban HIV/AIDS epidemic between 1986-2008 to fit the model. We obtain estimates for the detection-related parameters during two separate time periods to reflect the timeline of the implementation of various types of searches. The reproduction numbers for each time period are also computed from the sets of values of the parameters. We found that random screening is most important as a mean of surveillance. Moreover, local asymptotic stability for the Disease Free Equilibrium can be achieved if (i) random screening is sufficiently effective and (ii) infection by detected HIV-positive individuals is minimal. Our results highlight the importance of education for the known infectious for the purpose of preventing further infection. Fitting the 1986-2008 HIV data to obtain the model parameter estimates indicates that the HIV epidemic in Cuba is currently approaching an endemic equilibrium.

The virus penetrates the organism through the respiratory tract, conveyed by contaminated droplets. The main cell receptor targeted is the surface-bound ACE-2. As of the 26th July 2020, 15,200,000 COVID-19 cases and 650,000 deaths were reported worldwide. The mortality rate is estimated between 1.3 and 18.3%. The reproductive rate without any public health intervention is estimated around 4-5.1 in France. Most hospitalized patients for COVID-19 present respiratory symptoms, which in some cases is associated with fever. Up to 86% of admissions to ICU are related to acute respiratory failure. To date, no anti-viral therapy has proven its efficacy considering randomized trials.

Italy is one of the worst affected countries in Europe. Although there is a trend of relief, the epidemic situation hasn't stabilized yet. This study aims to investigate the dynamics of the disease spread in Italy and provide some suggestions on containing the epidemic. METHODS: We compared Italy's status at the outbreak stage and control measures with Guangdong Province in China by data observation and analysis. A modified autonomous SEIR model was used to study the COVID-19 epidemic and transmission potential during the early stage of the outbreak in Italy. We also utilized a time-dependent dynamic model to study the future disease dynamics in Italy. The impact of various non-pharmaceutical control measures on epidemic was investigated through uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. RESULTS: The comparison of specific measures implemented in the two places and the time when the measures were initiated shows that the initial prevention and control actions in Italy were not sufficiently timely and effective. We estimated parameter values based on available cumulative data and calculated the basic reproduction number to be 4.32 before the national lockdown in Italy. Based on the estimated parameter values, we performed numerical simulations to predict the epidemic trend and evaluate the impact of contact limitation, detection and diagnosis, and individual behavior change due to media coverage on the epidemic. CONCLUSIONS: Italy was in a severe epidemic status and the control measures were not sufficiently timely and effective in the beginning. Non-pharmaceutical interventions, including contact restrictions and improvement of case recognition, play an important role in containing the COVID-19 epidemic. The effect of individual behavior changes due to media update of the outbreak cannot be ignored. For policy-makers, early and strict blockade measures, fast detection and improving media publicity are key to containing the epidemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this manuscript, we attempt to estimate the impact of these steps across ten selected Indian states using crowd-sourced data. The trajectory of the outbreak was parameterized by the reproduction number (R0), doubling time, and growth rate. These parameters were estimated at two time-periods after the enforcement of the lockdown on 24th March 2020, i.e. 15 days into lockdown and 30 days into lockdown. The authors used a crowd sourced database which is available in the public domain. After preparing the data for analysis, R0 was estimated using maximum likelihood (ML) method which is based on the expectation minimum algorithm where the distribution probability of secondary cases is maximized using the serial interval discretization. The doubling time and growth rate were estimated by the natural log transformation of the exponential growth equation. The overall analysis shows decreasing trends in time-varying reproduction numbers (R(t)) and growth rate (with a few exceptions) and increasing trends in doubling time. The curtailment strategies employed by the Indian government seem to be effective in reducing the transmission parameters of the COVID-19 epidemic. The estimated R(t) are still above the threshold of 1, and the resultant absolute case numbers show an increase with time. Future curtailment and mitigation strategies thus may take into account these findings while formulating further course of action.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We present a method to determine the relative risk that can be readily deployed on either modelled or monitored CO$_2$ data and occupancy levels within an indoor space. Moreover, for spaces regularly, or consistently, occupied by the same group of people, e.g. an open-plan office or a school classroom, we establish protocols to assess the absolute risk of airborne infection of this regular attendance at work or school. In so doing, we are able to calculate the expected number of infections arising from a single regular attendee becoming infectious and remaining pre/asymptomatic, i.e. we present a robust methodology to calculate the absolute reproductive number of these spaces. We demonstrate our model by calculating risks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored data recorded within a small naturally ventilated office. Results suggest that attendance at work is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pandemic if relatively quiet desk-based work is carried out in the presence of adequate ventilation. However, these spaces are likely to contribute significantly to the pandemic if ventilation is inadequate and/or activity levels increase.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

For the latter, we show the variation in herd immunity levels implied by temperature-driven, time-varying R(0) series for the Alpha and Delta variants of COVID-19 for several representative states.

The proposed model is inspired partly from the evolutionary based state of the art genetic algorithm. The rate of virus evolution, spread and transmission of the COVID 19 and its associated recovery and death rate are modeled using the principle inspired from evolutionary algorithm. Furthermore, the interaction within a community and interaction outside the community is modeled. The constraint with respect to interaction has been implemented by a machine learning type algorithm and becomes the unique part of our study . Using this model, the maximum healthcare threshold is fixed as a constraint. Our evolutionary based model distinguishes between individuals in the population depending on the severity of their symptoms/infection based on the fitness value of the individuals. There is a need to differentiate between virus infected diagnosed (Self isolated) and virus infected non-diagnosed (Highly interacting) sub populations/group. In this study the model results does not compare the number outcomes with any actual real time data based curves. However, the results from the model demonstrates that a strict lockdown, social-distancing measures in conjunction with more number of testing and contact tracing is required to flatten the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic curve. A reproductive number of 2.4 during the initial spread of virus is predicted from the model for the randomly considered population.

The viruses were absent before the outbreaks, but each was present in ill chimpanzees from one community during the outbreak period. Clinical signs and gross pathologic changes in affected chimpanzees closely mirrored symptoms and pathology commonly observed in humans for each virus. Epidemiologic modelling showed that MPV and HRV3 were similarly transmissible (R(0) of 1.27 and 1.48, respectively), but MPV caused 12.2% mortality mainly in infants and older chimpanzees, whereas HRV3 caused no direct mortality. These results are consistent with the higher virulence of MPV than HRV3 in humans, although both MPV and HRV3 cause a significant global disease burden. Both viruses clustered phylogenetically within groups of known human variants, with MPV closely related to a lethal 2009 variant from mountain gorillas (Gorilla beringei beringei), suggesting two independent and simultaneous reverse zoonotic origins, either directly from humans or via intermediary hosts. These findings expand our knowledge of human origin viruses threatening wild chimpanzees and suggest that such viruses might be differentiated by their comparative epidemiological dynamics and pathogenicity in wild apes.

We show that estimates based on the millions of molecular tests in the US has the same mean square error as a small simple random sample. To address this, a procedure is presented that combines case-count data and random samples over time to estimate selection propensities based on key covariate information. We then combine these selection propensities with epidemiological forecast models to construct a doubly robust estimation method that accounts for both measurement-error and selection bias. This method is then applied to estimate Indiana's prevalence using case-count, hospitalization, and death data with demographic information, a statewide random molecular sample collected from April 25--29th, and Facebook's COVID-19 symptom survey.

We aim to equip local public health decision- and policy-makers with mathematical model-based quantification of implemented public health measures and estimation of the trend of COVID-19 in Ontario to inform future actions in terms of outbreak control and de-escalation of social distancing. Our estimates confirm that (1) social distancing measures have helped mitigate transmission by reducing daily infection contact rate, but the disease transmission probability per contact remains as high as 0.145 and case detection rate was so low that the effective reproduction number remained higher than the threshold for disease control until the closure of non-essential business in the Province; (2) improvement in case detection rate and closure of non-essential business had resulted in further reduction of the effective control number to under the threshold. We predict the number of confirmed cases according to different control efficacies including a combination of reducing further contact rates and transmission probability per contact. We show that improved case detection rate plays a decisive role to reduce the effective reproduction number, and there is still much room in terms of improving personal protection measures to compensate for the strict social distancing measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Strategies for safe operation of schools during pandemics therefore need to carefully consider both the efficiency of measures for infection control and the impact on children through lost face-to face schooling time. Heterogeneous social contact patterns associated with the social structures of schools (i.e. classes/grades) are likely to influence the within-school transmission dynamics;however, empirical evidence on the fine-scale transmission patterns between students has been limited. Using a mathematical model, we analysed a large-scale dataset of seasonal influenza outbreaks in Matsumoto city, Japan to infer social interactions within and between classes/grades from observed transmission patterns. The overall within-school reproduction number, which determines the initial growth of cases and the risk of sustained transmission, was only minimally associated with class sizes and the number of classes per grade. We then used these patterns in a model parameterised separately to COVID-19 and pandemic influenza, and simulated school outbreaks under multiple strategies for minimising the risk of within-school transmission. Simulations suggested that with such transmission patterns, interventions changing class structures (e.g. reduced class sizes) may not be effective in reducing the risk of major school outbreaks upon introduction of a case and that other precautionary measures (e.g. screening and isolation) need to be employed. Class-level closures in response to detection of a case were suggested to be effective in reducing the size of an outbreak when regular screening tests for students are not available.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Using ICE detainee population data obtained from the ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) website as of March 2, 2020, we implemented a simple stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered model to estimate the rate of COVID-19 transmission within 111 ICE detention facilities and then examined impacts on regional hospital intensive care unit (ICU) capacity. Models considered three scenarios of transmission (optimistic, moderate, pessimistic) over 30-, 60-, and 90-day time horizons across a range of facility sizes. We found that 72% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under the optimistic scenario (R0 = 2.5), while nearly 100% of individuals are expected to be infected by day 90 under a more pessimistic (R0 = 7) scenario. Although asynchronous outbreaks are more likely, day 90 estimates provide an approximation of total positive cases after all ICE facility outbreaks. We determined that, in the most optimistic scenario, coronavirus outbreaks among a minimum of 65 ICE facilities (59%) would overwhelm ICU beds within a 10-mile radius and outbreaks among a minimum of 8 ICE facilities (7%) would overwhelm local ICU beds within a 50-mile radius over a 90-day period, provided every ICU bed was made available for sick detainees. As policymakers seek to rapidly implement interventions that ensure the continued availability of life-saving medical resources across the USA, they may be overlooking the pressing need to slow the spread of COVID-19 infection in ICE's detention facilities. Preventing the rapid spread necessitates intervention measures such as granting ICE detainees widespread release from an unsafe environment by returning them to the community.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We describe the control measures used and their relationship with imported and domestically-acquired case numbers. Methods: Data on the first 270 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases and the timing and nature of control measures were captured by Vietnam's National Steering Committee for COVID-19 response. Apple and Google mobility data provided population movement proxies. Serial intervals were calculated from 33 infector-infectee pairs and used to estimate the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission events and time-varying reproduction numbers. Results: After the first confirmed case on January 23rd, the Vietnamese Government initiated mass communications measures, contact tracing, mandatory 14-day quarantine, school and university closures, and progressive flight restrictions. A national lockdown was implemented between April 1st and 22nd. Around 200,000 people were quarantined and 266,122 RT-PCR tests conducted. Population mobility decreased progressively before lockdown. 60% (163/270) of cases were imported; 43% (89/208) of resolved infections were asymptomatic. 21 developed severe disease, with no deaths. The serial interval was 3.24 days, and 27.5% (95% confidence interval, 15.7%-40.0%) of transmissions occurred pre-symptomatically. Limited transmission amounted to a maximum reproduction number of 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 0.37-2.36). No community transmission has been detected since April 15th. Conclusions: Vietnam has controlled SARS-CoV-2 spread through the early introduction of communication, contact-tracing, quarantine, and international travel restrictions. The value of these interventions is supported by the high proportion of asymptomatic cases and imported cases, and evidence for substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The model is suitable for populations where two frequent modes of transmission of hepatitis C virus, namely unsafe blood transfusions and intravenous drug use, are dominant. The susceptible population is divided into two distinct compartments, the intravenous drug users and individuals undergoing unsafe blood transfusions. Individuals belonging to each compartment may develop acute and then possibly chronic infections. Chronically infected individuals may be quarantined. The analysis indicates that the eradication and persistence of the disease is completely determined by the magnitude of basic reproduction number R (c). It is shown that for the basic reproduction number R (c) < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is locally and globally asymptotically stable. For R (c) > 1, an endemic equilibrium exists and the disease is uniformly persistent. In addition, we present the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses to investigate the influence of different important model parameters on the disease prevalence.

Estimating the Impact of School Classroom Sizes on the Probability of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 Infectivity or Exposure\nBACKGROUND: Despite schools reopening across the United States in communities with low and high Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prevalence, data remain scarce about the effect of classroom size on the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-COV-2) within schools. This study estimates the effect of classroom size on the risk of COVID-19 infection in a closed classroom cohort for varying age groups locally in Durham, North Carolina. Total number of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infections over a 28-day follow-up period for varying classroom reproduction number (R0) and varying classroom cohort sizes of 15 students, 30 students and 100 students in Durham County, North Carolina. [Image: see text] METHODS: Using publicly available population and COVID-19 case count data from Durham County, we calculated a weekly average number of new confirmed COVID-19 cases per week between May 3, 2020 and August 22, 2020 according to age categories: < 5 years, 5-9 years, 10-14 years, and 15-19 years. We collated average classroom cohort sizes and enrollment data for each age group by grade level of education for the first month of the 2019-2020 academic school year. Then, using a SEIR compartmental model, we calculated the number of susceptible (S), exposed (E), infectious (I) and recovered (R) students in a cohort size of 15, 30 and 100 students, modelling for classroom reproduction number (R(0)) of 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 within a closed classroom cohort over a 14-day and 28-day follow-up period using age group-specific COVID-19 prevalence rates. RESULTS: The SEIR model estimated that the increase in cohort size resulted in up to 5 new COVID-19 infections per 10,000 students whereas the classroom R(0) had a stronger effect, with up to 88 new infections per 10,000 students in a closed classroom cohort over time. When comparing different follow-up periods in a closed cohort with R(0) of 0.5, we estimated 12 more infected students per 10,000 students over 28 days as compared to 14 days irrespective of cohort size. With a R(0) of 2.5, there were 49 more infected students per 10,000 students over 28 days as compared to 14 days. CONCLUSION: Classroom R(0) had a stronger impact in reducing school-based COVID-19 transmission events as compared to cohort size. Additionally, earlier isolation of newly infected students in a closed cohort resulted in fewer new COVID-19 infections within that group. Mitigation strategies should target promoting safe practices within the school setting including early quarantine of newly identified contacts and minimizing COVID-19 community prevalence.

As a consequence, a new scenario of multiple imperfect vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 arose. Mathematical modeling needs to consider this complex situation with different vaccines, some of them with two required doses. Using compartmental models we can simplify, simulate and most importantly, answer questions related to the development of the outbreak and the vaccination campaign. We present a model that addresses the current situation of COVID-19 and vaccination. Two important questions were considered in this paper: are more vaccines useful to reduce the spread of the coronavirus? How can we know if the vaccination campaign is sufficient? Two sensitivity criteria are helpful to answer these questions. The first criterion is the Multiple Vaccination Theorem, which indicates whether a vaccine is giving a positive or negative impact on the reproduction number. The second result (Insufficiency Theorem) provides a condition to answer the second question. Finally, we fitted the parameters with data and discussed the empirical results of six countries: Israel, Germany, the Czech Republic, Portugal, Italy, and Lithuania.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Transmission by pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic viral carriers rendered intervention and containment of the disease extremely challenging. Based on reported infection case studies, we construct an epidemiological model that focuses on transmission around the symptom onset. The model is calibrated against incubation period and pairwise transmission statistics during the initial outbreaks of the pandemic outside Wuhan with minimal non-pharmaceutical interventions. Mathematical treatment of the model yields explicit expressions for the size of latent and pre-symptomatic subpopulations during the exponential growth phase, with the local epidemic growth rate as input. We then explore reduction of the basic reproduction number R0 through specific transmission control measures such as contact tracing, testing, social distancing, wearing masks and sheltering in place. When these measures are implemented in combination, their effects on R0 multiply. We also compare our model behaviour to the first wave of the COVID-19 spreading in various affected regions and highlight generic and less generic features of the pandemic development.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this study, we focused on exploring the temporal dynamics of MERS-CoV in human populations in the Arabian Peninsula between 2012 and 2017, using publicly available data on case counts and combining two analytical methods. Disease progression was assessed by quantifying the time-dependent reproductive number (TD-Rs), while case series temporal pattern was modelled using the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We accounted for geographical variability between three major affected regions in Saudi Arabia including Eastern Province, Riyadh and Makkah. In Saudi Arabia, the epidemic size was large with TD-Rs >1, indicating significant spread until 2017. In both Makkah and Riyadh regions, the epidemic progression reached its peak in April 2014 (TD-Rs > 7), during the highest incidence period of MERS-CoV cases. In Eastern Province, one unique super-spreading event (TD-R > 10) was identified in May 2013, which comprised of the most notable cases of human-to-human transmission. Best-fitting ARIMA model inferred statistically significant biannual seasonality in Riyadh region, a region characterised by heavy seasonal camel-related activities. However, no statistical evidence of seasonality was identified in Eastern Province and Makkah. Instead, both areas were marked by an endemic pattern of cases with sporadic outbreaks. Our study suggested new insights into the epidemiology of the virus, including inferences about epidemic progression and evidence for seasonality. Despite the inherent limitations of the available data, our conclusions provide further guidance to currently implement risk-based surveillance in high-risk populations and, subsequently, improve related interventions strategies against the epidemic at country and regional levels.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: This cohort study enrolled all pediatric patients admitted to 8 hospitals in Zhejiang Province of China between 21 January and 29 February 2020, their family members and close-contact classmates. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected. Bioinformatics was used to analyze the features of SARS-CoV-2. Individuals were divided into 3 groups by the first-generation case: Groups 1 (unclear), 2 (adult), and 3 (child). The secondary attack rate (SAR) and R(0) were compared among the groups. RESULTS: The infection rate among 211 individuals was 64%(135/211). The SAR in Groups 2 and 3 was 71%(73/103) and 3%(1/30), respectively; the median R(0) in Groups 2 and 3 was 2 (range: 1-8) and 0 (range: 0-1), respectively. Compared with adult cases, the SAR and R(0) of pediatric cases were significantly lower (p<0.05). We obtained SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the same infant's throat and fecal samples at a two-month interval and found that the new spike protein A958D mutation detected in the stool improved thermostability theoretically. CONCLUSIONS: Children have lower ability to spread SARS-CoV-2. The new A958D mutation is a potential reason for its long residence in the intestine.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In order to re-open parts of society, policy-makers need to consider how combinations of measures will affect transmission and understand the trade-offs between them. We use age-specific social contact data, together with epidemiological data, to quantify the components of the COVID-19 reproduction number. We estimate the impact of social distancing policies on the reproduction number by turning contacts on and off based on context and age. We focus on the impact of re-opening schools against a background of wider social distancing measures. We demonstrate that pre-collected social contact data can be used to provide a time-varying estimate of the reproduction number (R). We find that following lockdown (when R = 0.7, 95% CI 0.6, 0.8), opening primary schools has a modest impact on transmission (R = 0.89, 95% CI 0.82\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.97) as long as other social interactions are not increased.

Contact tracing and COVID security can be used to mitigate the impact of increased social mixing to some extent; however, social distancing measures are still required to control transmission.

The model assumes a time-varying effective contact rate (equivalently, a time-varying reproduction number) to model the effect of non-pharmaceutical interventions. A crucial technical challenge in applying such models is their accurate calibration to observed data, e.g. to the daily number of confirmed new cases, as the history of the disease strongly affects predictions of future scenarios.

This to evaluate a possible suspension from work through the use of the deterministic SIR model. The research was developed using a descriptive model, since it is only intended to expose the operation of the system. The random variable considered was the infection rate, also known as the basic reproduction number R0, which fluctuates between 0.5 and 2.5. A dynamic transmission rate and a constant recovery rate were applied in the investigation. An Excel spreadsheet was used, and the data obtained was plotted. The data taken for the simulation was from February 20, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The result reflected a significant difference between the historical data and the data obtained in the simulation, this due to the behavior of the dynamic variables that indicated an approximate error of 6,600,000. It can also be observed that the infected cases obtained from the simulation maintain a positive slope, therefore, there is the possibility that this variable will continue to grow. It is worth mentioning that for there to be a work suspension, it was considered that the average R0 was greater than 1.79, considering this as an intermediate value when industrial work was suspended in Mexico. The result obtained from the average R0 was 1.43, which promises a considerable decrease in infections and in view of the restriction, it was concluded that there is no new work suspension in Mexico due to COVID-19. But considering that R0 is greater than 1, there is latency of infections, therefore, preventive measures must be maintained. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 IEEE.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: We compared four testing strategies: 1) Hospitalized: PCR testing only patients with severe/critical symptoms warranting hospitalization; 2) Symptomatic: PCR for any COVID-19-consistent symptoms, with self-isolation if positive; 3) Symptomatic+asymptomatic-once: Symptomatic and one-time PCR for the entire population; and, 4) Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly: Symptomatic with monthly re-testing for the entire population. We examined effective reproduction numbers (R(e), 0.9-2.0) at which policy conclusions would change. We assumed homogeneous mixing among the Massachusetts population (excluding those residing in long-term care facilities). We used published data on disease progression and mortality, transmission, PCR sensitivity/specificity (70/100%) and costs. Model-projected outcomes included infections, deaths, tests performed, hospital-days, and costs over 180-days, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER, $/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]). RESULTS: At R(e) 0.9, Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly vs. Hospitalized resulted in a 64% reduction in infections and a 46% reduction in deaths, but required >66-fold more tests/day with 5-fold higher costs.

The reproductive number of coronavirus provides an estimate of the possible extent of the transmission. This study aims to provide a summary reproductive number of coronavirus based on available global level evidence. METHODS: A total of three databases were searched on September 15, 2020: PubMed, Web of Science, and Science Direct. The searches were conducted using a pre-specified search strategy to record studies reported the reproductive number of coronavirus from its inception in December 2019. It includes keywords of coronavirus and its reproductive number, which were combined using the Boolean operators (AND, OR). Based on the included studies, we estimated a summary reproductive number by using the meta-analysis. We used narrative synthesis to explain the results of the studies where the reproductive number was reported, however, were not possible to include in the meta-analysis because of the lack of data (mostly due to confidence interval was not reported). RESULTS: Total of 42 studies included in this review whereas 29 of them were included in the meta-analysis. The estimated summary reproductive number was 2.87 (95% CI, 2.39-3.44). We found evidence of very high heterogeneity (99.5%) of the reproductive number reported in the included studies. Our sub-group analysis was found the significant variations of reproductive number across the country for which it was estimated, method and model that were used to estimate the reproductive number, number of case that was considered to estimate the reproductive number, and the type of reproductive number that was estimated. The highest reproductive number was reported for the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship in Japan (14.8). In the country-level, the higher reproductive number was reported for France (R, 6.32, 95% CI, 5.72-6.99) following Germany (R, 6.07, 95% CI, 5.51-6.69) and Spain (R, 3.56, 95% CI, 1.62-7.82). The higher reproductive number was reported if it was estimated by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method (MCMC) method and the Epidemic curve model. We also reported significant heterogeneity of the type of reproductive number- a high-value reported if it was the time-dependent reproductive number. CONCLUSION: The estimated summary reproductive number indicates an exponential increase of coronavirus infection in the coming days.

In the present study, using the Gillespie-based epidemic model, we focused on each single trajectory by the stochastic simulation to infer the probability of controlling an epidemic by non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs). The single trajectory analysis by the stochastic simulation suggested that a few infected people sometimes dissipated spontaneously without spreading of infection. The outbreak probability was affected by basic reproductive number but not by infectious duration and susceptible population size. A comparative analysis suggested that the mean trajectory by the stochastic simulation has equivalent dynamics to a conventional deterministic model in terms of epidemic forecasting. The probability of outbreak containment by NPIs was inferred by trajectories derived from 1000 Monte Carlo simulation trials using model parameters assuming COVID-19 epidemic. The model-based analysis indicated that complete containment of the disease could be achieved by short-duration NPIs if performed early after the import of infected individuals. Under the correctness of the model assumptions, analysis of each trajectory by Gillespie-based stochastic model would provide a unique and valuable output such as the probabilities of outbreak containment by NPIs.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We developed an efficient, rapid, and scalable surveillance strategy to detect remaining COVID-19 community cases through exhaustive identification of every active transmission chain. We identified measures to enable early detection and effective management of any reintroduction of transmission once containment measures are lifted to ensure strong containment measures do not require reinstatement. METHODS: We compared efficiency and sensitivity to detect community transmission chains through testing of the following: hospital cases; fever, cough and/or ARI testing at community/primary care; and asymptomatic testing; using surveillance evaluation methods and mathematical modelling, varying testing capacities, reproductive number (R) and weekly cumulative incidence of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 respiratory symptoms using data from Australia. We assessed system requirements to identify all transmission chains and follow up all cases and primary contacts within each chain, per million population. RESULTS: Assuming 20% of cases are asymptomatic and 30% of symptomatic COVID-19 cases present for testing, with R = 2.2, a median of 14 unrecognised community cases (8 infectious) occur when a transmission chain is identified through hospital surveillance versus 7 unrecognised cases (4 infectious) through community-based surveillance. The 7 unrecognised community upstream cases are estimated to generate a further 55\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015377 primary contacts requiring follow-up. The unrecognised community cases rise to 10 if 50% of cases are asymptomatic. Screening asymptomatic community members cannot exhaustively identify all cases under any of the scenarios assessed. The most important determinant of testing requirements for symptomatic screening is levels of non-COVID-19 respiratory illness. If 4% of the community have respiratory symptoms, and 1% of those with symptoms have COVID-19, exhaustive symptomatic screening requires approximately 11,600 tests/million population using 1/4 pooling, with 98% of cases detected (2% missed), given 99.9% sensitivity. Even with a drop in sensitivity to 70%, pooling was more effective at detecting cases than individual testing under all scenarios examined. CONCLUSIONS: Screening all acute respiratory disease in the community, in combination with exhaustive and meticulous case and contact identification and management, enables appropriate early detection and elimination of COVID-19 community transmission. An important component is identification, testing, and management of all contacts, including upstream contacts (i.e. potential sources of infection for identified cases, and their related transmission chains). Pooling allows increased case detection when testing capacity is limited, even given reduced test sensitivity. Critical to the effectiveness of all aspects of surveillance is appropriate community engagement, messaging to optimise testing uptake and compliance with other measures.

We named this model EpiBeds. Data from a partially complete patient-pathway line-list was used to provide initial estimates of the mean duration that individuals spend in the different hospital compartments. We then fitted EpiBeds using complete data on hospital occupancy and hospital deaths, enabling estimation of the proportion of individuals that follow different clinical pathways, and the reproduction number of the generalised epidemic. The construction of EpiBeds makes it straightforward to adapt to different patient pathways and settings beyond England.

Methods: COVID-19 case series (March 6, 2020 - January 10, 2021) were shifted by 9 days to approximate the infection date. We analyzed the effects of state and county policies on Rt using EpiEstim. We performed linear regression to evaluate if per-capita cumulative case count varies across counties with different population size. Results: Rt shifted from 2-3 in March to <1 during April and May. Rt rose over the summer and stayed between 1.4 and 0.7. The introduction of statewide mask mandates was associated with a decline in Rt (-15.3%; 95% CrI, -13.6%, -16.8%), and school re-opening, an increase by 12.3% (95% CrI, 10.1%, 14.4%). Less densely populated counties had higher attack rate (p<0.0001). Conclusion: The Rt dynamics over time indicated that public health interventions substantially slowed COVID-19 transmission in South Carolina, while their relaxation may have promoted further transmission.

                "prompt": "Epidemic spreading under pathogen evolution\nBattling a widespread pandemic is an arms race between our mitigation efforts, e.g., social distancing or vaccination, and the pathogen's evolving persistence. This is being observed firsthand during the current COVID-19 crisis, as novel mutations challenge our global vaccination race. To address this, we introduce here a general framework to model epidemic spreading under pathogen evolution, finding that mutations can fundamentally alter the projection of the spread. Specifically, we detect a new pandemic phase - the mutated phase - in which, despite the fact that the pathogen is initially non-pandemic (R0<1), it may still spread due to the emergence of a critical mutation. The boundaries of this phase portray a balance between the epidemic and the evolutionary time-scales. If the mutation rate is too low, the pathogen prevalence decays prior to the appearance of a critical mutation. On the other hand, if mutations are too rapid, the pathogen evolution becomes volatile and, once again, it fails to spread. Between these two extremes, however, we observe a broad range of conditions in which an initially sub-pandemic pathogen will eventually gain prevalence. This is especially relevant during vaccination, which creates, as it progresses, increasing selection pressure towards vaccine-resistance. To overcome this, we show that vaccination campaigns must be accompanied by fierce mitigation efforts, to suppress the potential rise of a resistant mutant strain.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

PD is characterized by chronic inflammation and dysbiosis. Nevertheless, the molecular mechanisms and use of feasible therapeutic strategies to reduce/reverse inflammation and dysbiosis remain understudied and unaddressed. METHODS: Employing a systems biology approach, we report molecular, metabolome and microbiome changes underlying PD and its modulation by phytocannabinoids [delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (\u00c3\u017d\u00e2\u20ac\u009d(9)-THC)] in uninfected and SIV-infected rhesus macaques (RMs) untreated (VEH-untreated/SIV) or treated with vehicle (VEH/SIV) or \u00c3\u017d\u00e2\u20ac\u009d(9)-THC (THC/SIV). FINDINGS: VEH- untreated/SIV but not THC/SIV RMs showed significant enrichment of genes linked to anti-viral defense, interferon-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2, NF\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00baB, RIG-1, and JAK-STAT signaling. We focused on the anti-microbial DUOX1 and immune activation marker IDO1 that were reciprocally regulated in the gingiva of VEH-untreated/SIV RMs. Both proteins localized to the gingival epithelium and CD163(+) macrophages, and showed differential expression in the gingiva of THC/SIV and VEH/SIV RMs. Additionally, inflammation-associated miR-21, miR-142\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533p, miR-223, and miR-125a-5p showed significantly higher expression in the gingiva of VEH/SIV RMs. In human primary gingival epithelial cells, miR-125a-5p post-transcriptionally downregulated DUOX1 and THC inhibited IDO1 protein expression through a cannabinoid receptor-2 mediated mechanism. Interestingly, THC/SIV RMs showed relatively reduced plasma levels of kynurenine, kynurenate, and the neurotoxic quinolinate compared to VEH/SIV RMs at 5 months post SIV infection (MPI). Most importantly, THC blocked HIV/SIV-induced depletion of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, and reduced Gammaproteobacteria abundance in saliva. Reduced IDO1 protein expression was associated with significantly (p<0.05) higher abundance of Prevotella, Lactobacillus (L. salivarius, L. buchneri, L. fermentum, L. paracasei, L. rhamnosus, L. johnsonii) and Bifidobacteria and reduced abundance of the pathogenic Porphyromonas cangingivalis and Porphyromonas macacae at 5MPI. INTERPRETATION: The data provides deeper insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying HIV/SIV-induced PD and more importantly, the anti-inflammatory and anti-dysbiotic properties of THC in the oral cavity. Overall, these translational findings suggest that phytocannabinoids may help reduce gingival/systemic inflammation, salivary dysbiosis and potentially metabolic disease/syndrome in PLWH on cART and those with no access to cART or do not suppress the virus under cART.

A quantitative understanding of transmission dynamics in domestic dog populations provides critical information to assess whether global elimination of canine rabies is possible. We report extensive observations of individual rabid animals in Tanzania and generate a uniquely detailed analysis of transmission biology, which explains important epidemiological features, including the level of variation in epidemic trajectories. We found that the basic reproductive number for rabies, R(0), is very low in our study area in rural Africa (\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00c2\u00bc1.2) and throughout its historic global range (<2). This finding provides strong support for the feasibility of controlling endemic canine rabies by vaccination, even near wildlife areas with large wild carnivore populations. However, we show that rapid turnover of domestic dog populations has been a major obstacle to successful control in developing countries, thus regular pulse vaccinations will be required to maintain population-level immunity between campaigns. Nonetheless our analyses suggest that with sustained, international commitment, global elimination of rabies from domestic dog populations, the most dangerous vector to humans, is a realistic goal.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Understanding the genomic, epidemiologic, and clinical characteristics of person-to-person transmission of ANDV is crucial to designing effective interventions. METHODS: Clinical and epidemiologic information was obtained by means of patient report and from public health centers. Serologic testing, contact-tracing, and next-generation sequencing were used to identify ANDV infection as the cause of this outbreak of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and to reconstruct person-to-person transmission events. RESULTS: After a single introduction of ANDV from a rodent reservoir into the human population, transmission was driven by 3 symptomatic persons who attended crowded social events. After 18 cases were confirmed, public health officials enforced isolation of persons with confirmed cases and self-quarantine of possible contacts; these measures most likely curtailed further spread. The median reproductive number (the number of secondary cases caused by an infected person during the infectious period) was 2.12 before the control measures were enforced and decreased to 0.96 after the measures were implemented. Full genome sequencing of the ANDV strain involved in this outbreak was performed with specimens from 27 patients and showed that the strain that was present (Epuy?\u00a9n/18-19) was similar to the causative strain (Epilink/96) in the first known person-to-person transmission of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome caused by ANDV, which occurred in El Bols?\u00b3n, Argentina, in 1996. Clinical investigations involving patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in this outbreak revealed that patients with a high viral load and liver injury were more likely than other patients to spread infection. Disease severity, genomic diversity, age, and time spent in the hospital had no clear association with secondary transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with ANDV hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, high viral titers in combination with attendance at massive social gatherings or extensive contact among persons were associated with a higher likelihood of transmission.

METHODS: Here, we evaluated in mice and hamsters the efficacy of a pre-clinical version of the Moderna mRNA vaccine (mRNA-1273) and the Johnson & Johnson recombinant adenoviral-vectored vaccine (Ad26.COV2.S) against the B.1.621 (Mu) variant of SARS-CoV-2, which contains spike mutations T95I, Y144S, Y145N, R346K, E484K, N501Y, D614G, P681H, and D950N. FINDINGS: Immunization of 129S2 and K18-human ACE2 transgenic mice with the mRNA-1273 vaccine protected against weight loss, lung infection, and lung pathology after challenge with the B.1.621 or WA1/2020 N501Y/D614G SARS-CoV-2 strain.

We aimed to quantify the extent to which disruptions to services for HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria in low-income and middle-income countries with high burdens of these diseases could lead to additional loss of life over the next 5 years. METHODS: Assuming a basic reproduction number of 3\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b70, we constructed four scenarios for possible responses to the COVID-19 pandemic: no action, mitigation for 6 months, suppression for 2 months, or suppression for 1 year. We used established transmission models of HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria to estimate the additional impact on health that could be caused in selected settings, either due to COVID-19 interventions limiting activities, or due to the high demand on the health system due to the COVID-19 pandemic. FINDINGS: In high-burden settings, deaths due to HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over 5 years could increase by up to 10%, 20%, and 36%, respectively, compared with if there was no COVID-19 pandemic. The greatest impact on HIV was estimated to be from interruption to antiretroviral therapy, which could occur during a period of high health system demand. For tuberculosis, the greatest impact would be from reductions in timely diagnosis and treatment of new cases, which could result from any prolonged period of COVID-19 suppression interventions. The greatest impact on malaria burden could be as a result of interruption of planned net campaigns. These disruptions could lead to a loss of life-years over 5 years that is of the same order of magnitude as the direct impact from COVID-19 in places with a high burden of malaria and large HIV and tuberculosis epidemics.

To investigate the effects of the saturation of media coverage and limited medical resources, we proposed a mathematical model with extra compartment of media coverage and two nonlinear functions. We theoretically and numerically investigate the dynamics of the proposed model. Given great difficulties caused by high nonlinearity in theoretical analysis, we separately considered subsystems with only nonlinear recovery or with only saturated media impact. For the model with only nonlinear recovery, we theoretically showed that backward bifurcation can occur and multiple equilibria may coexist under certain conditions in this case. Numerical simulations reveal the rich dynamic behaviors, including forward-backward bifurcation, Hopf bifurcation, saddle-node bifurcation, homoclinic bifurcation and unstable limit cycle. So the limitation of medical resources induces rich dynamics and causes much difficulties in eliminating the infectious diseases. We then investigated the dynamics of the system with only saturated media impact and concluded that saturated media impact hardly induces the complicated dynamics. Further, we parameterized the proposed model on the basis of the COVID-19 case data in mainland China and data related to news items, and estimated the basic reproduction number to be 2.86. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to quantify the relative importance of parameters in determining the cumulative number of infected individuals at the end of the first month of the outbreak.

Reporting delays between disease onset and case reporting hamper our ability to understand the dynamics of an epidemic close to now when looking at the number of daily reported cases only. Nowcasting can be used to adjust daily case counts for occurred-but-not-yet-reported events. Here, we present a novel application of nowcasting to data on the current COVID-19 pandemic in Bavaria.

(2020) fit an age structured SEIR model with added health service compartments to data on deaths, hospitalization and test results from Covid-19 in seven English regions for the period March to December 2020. The simplest version of the model has 684 states per region. One main conclusion is that only full lockdowns brought the pathogen reproduction number, R, below one, with R \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00ab 1 in all regions on the eve of March 2020 lockdown. We critically evaluate the Knock et al. epidemiological model, and the semi-causal conclusions made using it, based on an independent reimplementation of the model designed to allow relaxation of some of its strong assumptions. In particular, Knock et al. model the effect on transmission of both non-pharmaceutical interventions and other effects, such as weather, using a piecewise linear function, b(t), with 12 breakpoints at selected government announcement or intervention dates. We replace this representation by a smoothing spline with time varying smoothness, thereby allowing the form of b(t) to be substantially more data driven, and we check that the corresponding smoothness assumption is not driving our results. We also reset the mean incubation time and time from first symptoms to hospitalisation, used in the model, to values implied by the papers cited by Knock et al. as the source of these quantities. We conclude that there is no sound basis for using the Knock et al. model and their analysis to make counterfactual statements about the number of deaths that would have occurred with different lockdown timings. However, if fits of this epidemiological model structure are viewed as a reasonable basis for inference about the time course of incidence and R, then without very strong modelling assumptions, the pathogen reproduction number was probably below one, and incidence in substantial decline, some days before either of the first two English national lockdowns. This result coincides with that obtained by more direct attempts to reconstruct incidence. Of course it does not imply that lockdowns had no effect, but it does suggest that other non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) may have been much more effective than Knock et al. imply, and that full lockdowns were probably not the cause of R dropping below one.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Optimal periodic closure for minimizing risk in emerging disease outbreaks\nWithout vaccines and treatments, societies must rely on non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies to control the spread of emerging diseases such as COVID-19. Though complete lockdown is epidemiologically effective, because it eliminates infectious contacts, it comes with significant costs. Several recent studies have suggested that a plausible compromise strategy for minimizing epidemic risk is periodic closure, in which populations oscillate between wide-spread social restrictions and relaxation. However, no underlying theory has been proposed to predict and explain optimal closure periods as a function of epidemiological and social parameters. In this work we develop such an analytical theory for SEIR-like model diseases, showing how characteristic closure periods emerge that minimize the total outbreak, and increase predictably with the reproductive number and incubation periods of a disease, as long as both are within predictable limits. Using our approach we demonstrate a sweet-spot effect in which optimal periodic closure is maximally effective for diseases with similar incubation and recovery periods. Our results compare well to numerical simulations, including in COVID-19 models where infectivity and recovery show significant variability.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

First: across all countries and U.S. states that we study, the growth rates of daily deaths from COVID-19 fell from a wide range of initially high levels to levels close to zero within 20-30 days after each region experienced 25 cumulative deaths. Second: after this initial period, growth rates of daily deaths have hovered around zero or below everywhere in the world. Third: the cross section standard deviation of growth rates of daily deaths across locations fell very rapidly in the first 10 days of the epidemic and has remained at a relatively low level since then. Fourth: when interpreted through a range of epidemiological models, these first three facts about the growth rate of COVID deaths imply that both the effective reproduction numbers and transmission rates of COVID-19 fell from widely dispersed initial levels and the effective reproduction number has hovered around one after the first 30 days of the epidemic virtually everywhere in the world. We argue that failing to account for these four stylized facts may result in overstating the importance of policy mandated NPIs for shaping the progression of this deadly pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

A multi-scale model giving insights on the virus population dynamics, the transmission process and the infection mechanism is proposed first. Indeed, there are human to human virus transmission, human to environment virus transmission, environment to human virus transmission and self-infection by susceptible individuals. The global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is shown when a given threshold [Formula: see text] is less or equal to 1 and the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is calculated. A convergence index [Formula: see text] is also defined in order to estimate the speed at which the disease extincts and an upper bound to the time of infectious extinction is given. The existence of the endemic equilibrium is conditional and its description is provided. Using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficient with a three levels fractional experimental design, the sensitivity of [Formula: see text] , [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text] to control parameters is evaluated. Following this study, the most significant parameter is the probability of wearing mask followed by the probability of mobility and the disinfection rate. According to a functional cost taking into account economic impacts of SARS-CoV-2, optimal fighting strategies are determined and discussed. The study is applied to real and available data from Cameroon with a model fitting.

(Q2) When will be the peak and the end of the epidemic? (Q3) How do the asymptomatic infections affect the spread of disease? (Q4) What is the ratio of the population that needs to be infected to achieve herd immunity? (Q5) How effective are the social distancing approaches? (Q6) What is the ratio of the population infected in the long run? For (Q1) and (Q2), we propose a time-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks 2 time series: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at time t. Such an approach is more adaptive than traditional static SIR models and more robust than direct estimation methods. Using the data provided by China, we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed cases are almost in 3%, and the total number of confirmed cases is precisely predicted. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted. After that day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3), we extend our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable and undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model is characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely related to $R_0$. For (Q4), we show that herd immunity can be achieved after at least 1-1/$R_0$ fraction of individuals being infected. For (Q5) and (Q6), we analyze the independent cascade (IC) model for disease propagation in a configuration random graph. By relating the propagation probabilities in the IC model to the transmission rates and recovering rates in the SIR model, we show 2 approaches of social distancing that can lead to a reduction of $R_0$.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In 2017\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015318, LF caused an unprecedented epidemic in Nigeria and the situation was worsening in 2018\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319. This work aims to study the epidemiological features of epidemics in different Nigerian regions and quantify the association between reproduction number (R) and state rainfall. We quantify the infectivity of LF by the reproduction numbers estimated from four different growth models: the Richards, three-parameter logistic, Gompertz and Weibull growth models. LF surveillance data are used to fit the growth models and estimate the Rs and epidemic turning points (\u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u20ac\u017e) in different regions at different time periods. Cochran's Q test is further applied to test the spatial heterogeneity of the LF epidemics. A linear random-effect regression model is adopted to quantify the association between R and state rainfall with various lag terms.

The factors that determine the acceptance of COVID-19 apps remain unknown. The exception here is privacy. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article was to identify antecedents of acceptance of (1) a mobile app for COVID-19 symptom recognition and monitoring and (2) a mobile app for contact tracing, both by means of an online survey among Dutch citizens. METHODS: Next to the demographics, the online survey contained questions focusing on perceived health, fear of COVID-19, and intention to use. We used snowball sampling via posts on social media and personal connections. To identify antecedents of the model for acceptance of the 2 mobile apps, we conducted multiple linear regression analyses. RESULTS: In total, 238 Dutch adults completed the survey; 59.2% (n=141) of the responders were female and the average age was 45.6 years (SD 17.4 years). For the symptom app, the final model included the predictors age, attitude toward technology, and fear of COVID-19. The model had an r2 of 0.141. The final model for the tracing app included the same predictors and had an r2 of 0.156. The main reason to use both mobile apps was to control the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Concerns about privacy was mentioned as the main reason to not use the mobile apps. CONCLUSIONS: Age, attitude toward technology, and fear of COVID-19 are important predictors of the acceptance of COVID-19 mobile apps for symptom recognition and monitoring and for contact tracing. These predictors should be taken into account during the development and implementation of these mobile apps to secure acceptance.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We improve on their estimation by using data from the number of patients in intensive care, which provides two advantages over the number of deaths: first, it can be used to construct a signal with less bias: as the healthcare system of a country reaches saturation, the mortality rate would be expected to increase, which would bias the estimates of Rt and of the impact of measures implemented to contain the epidemic; and second, it is a signal with less lag, as the time from onset of symptoms to ICU admission is shorter than the time from onset to death. The intensive care signal we use is not just the number of people in ICU, as this would also be biased if the healthcare system has reached saturation. Instead, we estimate the daily demand of intensive care, as the sum of two components: the part that is satisfied (new ICU admissions) and the part that is not (which results in excess mortality). Thanks to the advantages of this ICU signal in terms of timeliness and bias, we find that most of the countries in the study have already reached Rt<1 with 95% confidence (Italy, Spain, Austria, Denmark, France, Norway and Switzerland, but not Belgium or Sweden), whereas the original methodology of Flaxman et al (2020), even with updated data, would only find Rt<1 with 95% confidence for Italy and Switzerland.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We aimed to develop a risk map for rubella epidemics in Japan by geographic location via analysis of seroepidemiological data and accounting for the abundance of foreign visitors. METHODS: Geographic age distribution and seroprevalence were used to compute the age- and sex-dependent next-generation matrix in each region. We computed the probability of a major epidemic using the assumed number of untraced imported rubella cases proportionally modeled to the number of foreign travelers. RESULTS: Risks of a major epidemic were high in areas with capital cities, while areas with a greater fraction of older people yielded smaller effective reproduction numbers, a lower volume of foreign travelers, and thus a lower probability of a major epidemic. The volume of susceptible adult males was larger in urban geographic regions, having a greater number of foreign travelers than remote areas.

Assessing the impact of such openings in relation to the risk of a resumption of the spread of the disease is an extremely difficult problem due to the many unknowns concerning the actual number of people infected, the actual reproduction number and infection fatality rate of the disease. In this work, starting from a SEIRD compartmental model with a social structure based on the age of individuals and stochastic inputs that account for data uncertainty, the effects of containment measures are introduced via an optimal control problem dependent on specific social activities, such as home, work, school, etc. Through a short time horizon approximation, we derive models with multiple feedback controls depending on social activities that allow us to assess the impact of selective relaxation of containment measures in the presence of uncertain data. After analyzing the effects of the various controls, results from different scenarios concerning the first wave of the epidemic in some major countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, are presented and discussed. Specific contact patterns in the home, work, school and other locations have been considered for each country. Numerical simulations show that a careful strategy of progressive relaxation of containment measures, such as that adopted by some governments, may be able to keep the epidemic under control by restarting various productive activities.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R(0) = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015340 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95).

Early implementation of lockdown protocols were useful to control certain parameters of transmission dynamics, but the numbers are consistently increasing in later months. India population is divided into different clusters on the basis of population density and population mobility, even varying resource availability and since the recent cases are coming from throughout the country, it allows us to model an overall average of the country. In this study, we try to prove the efficiency of using the SEIR epidemiological model for different rate study analysis for COVID epidemic in India. Along with it we derived newer components for better forecast of the pandemic in India. We found that there is a decrease in R0 value, but still the epidemic is not under control. The percentage of infected patients being admitted into ICU for critical care is around 9.986%, while the chances of recovery of critical patients being admitted to the ICU seem to be slim at 79.9% of the admitted being dead.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The elimination of this virus from our society needs proper attentions to follows the rule suggested by World Health Organization (WHO). A vast literature on the modeling of this infection in various perspective is available. In the present work, we design a new mathematical model for COVID-19 pandemic by utilizing the real infected cases reported from Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Initially, we formulate the model with the help of classical integer order nonlinear differential equations. The treatment class is considered the model to analyze the impact of treatment on the disease dynamics. The Caputo-Fabrizio derivative with the non-singular exponential kernel is applied in order to reformulate the proposed COVID-19 transmission model with a fractional order. The biologically important parameter called the basic reproductive number is investigated both theoretically and numerically. The estimated values of R 0 for the selected period are approximated to be 1.63 . Further, by making use of the Picard Lindel?\u00b6f theorem we provide the existence and uniqueness of the COVID-19 fractional epidemic model. Moreover, the fractional model is solved numerically and a number of simulation results are depicted using the real estimated parameters. The impact of various model parameters and memory index are shown graphically. We conclude that the fractional order epidemic models are more appropriate and provide deep insights into the disease dynamics.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The Chinese government executed a series of interventions to curb the pandemic. The \"battle\" against COVID-19 in Shenzhen, China is valuable because populated industrial cities are the epic centres of COVID-19 in many regions. We made use of synthetic control methods to create a reference population matching specific characteristics of Shenzhen. With both the synthetic and observed data, we introduced an epidemic compartmental model to compare the spread of COVID-19 between Shenzhen and its counterpart regions in the United States that didn't implement interventions for policy evaluation. Once the effects of policy interventions adopted in Shenzhen were estimated, the delay effects of those interventions were referred to provide the further control degree of interventions. Thus, the hypothetical epidemic situations in Shenzhen were inferred by using time-varying reproduction numbers in the proposed SIHR (Susceptible, Infectious, Hospitalized, Removed) model and considering if the interventions were delayed by 0 day to 5 days. The expected cumulative confirmed cases would be 1546, which is 5.75 times of the observed cumulative confirmed cases of 269 in Shenzhen on February 3, 2020, based on the data from the counterpart counties (mainly from Broward, New York, Santa Clara, Pinellas, and Westchester) in the United States. If the interventions were delayed by 5 days from the day when the interventions started, the expected cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen on February 3, 2020 would be 676 with 95% credible interval (303,1959). Early implementation of mild interventions can subdue the epidemic of COVID-19. The later the interventions were implemented, the more severe the epidemic was in the hard-hit areas. Mild interventions are less damaging to the society but can be effective when implemented early.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

It is assumed that the treatment response is proportional to the number of infected people as long as the incidence cases are within the capacity of the healthcare system, after which the value becomes constant, when the number of confirmed cases exceeds the carrying capacity of the available medical facilities. Thus, the basic reproduction number of the model is obtained. It is proved that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number is less than a critical value. Moreover, sufficient conditions are obtained to guarantee the local and global stability of the equilibrium points of the model. The numerical analysis reveals that multiple endemic equilibria may exist even when the basic reproduction number is less than one, and some interesting dynamics can be observed when the treatment parameter and immunity waning rate are varied.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, aggregated case report data suffers from reporting delays and can lead to misleading inferences. Different from aggregated case report data, line list data is a table contains individual features such as dates of symptom onset and reporting for each reported case and a good source for modeling delays. Current methods for modeling reporting delays are not particularly appropriate for line list data, which typically has missing symptom onset dates that are non-ignorable for modeling reporting delays. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian approach that dynamically integrates imputation and estimation for line list data. Specifically, this Bayesian approach can accurately estimate the epidemic curve and instantaneous reproduction numbers, even with most symptom onset dates missing. The Bayesian approach is also robust to deviations from model assumptions, such as changes in the reporting delay distribution or incorrect specification of the maximum reporting delay. We apply the Bayesian approach to COVID-19 line list data in Massachusetts and find the reproduction number estimates correspond more closely to the control measures than the estimates based on the reported curve.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The number of total infected cases has increased to 3662 on 05 April 2020, leading to the country being placed under lockdown. As the main public concern is whether the current situation will continue for the next few months, this study aims to predict the epidemic peak using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, with incorporation of the mortality cases. The infection rate was estimated using the Genetic Algorithm (GA), while the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was used to provide short-time forecasting of the number of infected cases. The results show that the estimated infection rate is 0.228 +or- 0.013, while the basic reproductive number is 2.28 +or- 0.13. The epidemic peak of COVID-19 in Malaysia could be reached on 26 July 2020, with an uncertain period of 30 days (12 July-11 August). Possible interventions by the government to reduce the infection rate by 25% over two or three months would delay the epidemic peak by 30 and 46 days, respectively. The forecasting results using the ANFIS model show a low Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) of 0.041;a low Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 2.45%;and a high coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.9964. The results also show that an intervention has a great effect on delaying the epidemic peak and a longer intervention period would reduce the epidemic size at the peak.

Object: We evaluated COVID-19 vaccination effects on infectiousness in Japan. Method: The effective reproduction number R(t) was regressed on vaccine coverage along with data of temperature, humidity, mobility, and countermeasures. We presumed two definitions for vaccine coverage: at least a single dose with a 12-day delay and a second dose. The study period was February, 2020 through May 16, 2021. Results: Estimation results indicate that vaccine coverage significantly and drastically reduced R(t) for both definitions. Results imply that increased first shot coverage by 1% point decreased R(t) by 0.5 with a 12 day delay. Moreover, increased second shot coverage by 1% point, decreased R(t) by 1 immediately.

The objective was to evaluate whether surgical oncology and medical oncology clinics, which have different operating styles, impact the timeliness of treatment. Additionally, we investigated the prognostic impact of the clinical and treatment-related factors in patients with esophageal cancer treated at our center. Methods This was a retrospective single-center study. The prognostic impact of resection type (R0 or R1-2), multimodal treatment, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion (PNI), lymph node metastases, cachexia at the time of diagnosis, smoking, and diagnostic application of endoscopic ultrasound was evaluated. Patients were stratified according to whether the orientation and management processes were based on a multimodal approach and whether they were first examined by a surgical oncologist or a medical oncologist for diagnostic workup and management. The impact of the management approach on progression-free survival (PFS) was evaluated. Results Use of a multimodal approach in patients with esophageal cancer was associated with longer PFS (26.7 vs 13.9 months, p = 0.002). LVI and cachexia were associated with shorter PFS (16.1 vs 29.4 months, p = 0.044 and 14.6 vs 29.0, p = 0.019, respectively). The first appointment of the patients in the medical oncology department was associated with shorter treatment delay (54 [IQR: 36-71] vs 31 [IQR: 24-48] days, p < 0.001). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the first appointment of patients in the medical oncology department may lead to a more systematic workup and treatment progress.

It has been shown that school closures could cause absenteeism among healthcare workers with dependent children, but there remains a need for spatially granular analyses of the relationship between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism to inform local community preparedness. METHODS: We provide national- and county-level simulations of school closures and unmet child care needs across the USA. We develop individual simulations using county-level demographic and occupational data, and model school closure effectiveness with age-structured compartmental models. We perform multivariate quasi-Poisson ecological regressions to find associations between unmet child care needs and COVID-19 vulnerability factors. RESULTS: At the national level, we estimate the projected rate of unmet child care needs for healthcare worker households to range from 7.4 to 8.7%, and the effectiveness of school closures as a 7.6% and 8.4% reduction in fewer hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, respectively, at peak demand when varying across initial reproduction number estimates by state. At the county level, we find substantial variations of projected unmet child care needs and school closure effects, 9.5% (interquartile range (IQR) 8.2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015310.9%) of healthcare worker households and 5.2% (IQR 4.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01536.5%) and 6.8% (IQR 4.8\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01538.8%) reduction in fewer hospital and ICU beds, respectively, at peak demand. We find significant positive associations between estimated levels of unmet child care needs and diabetes prevalence, county rurality, and race (p<0.05). We estimate costs of absenteeism and child care and observe from our models that an estimated 76.3 to 96.8% of counties would find it less expensive to provide child care to all healthcare workers with children than to bear the costs of healthcare worker absenteeism during school closures. CONCLUSIONS: School closures are projected to reduce peak ICU and hospital demand, but could disrupt healthcare systems through absenteeism, especially in counties that are already particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. Child care subsidies could help circumvent the ostensible trade-off between school closures and healthcare worker absenteeism.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

From the beginning of April 2020, the nationwide lockdown started to show early effects by reducing the total cumulative incidence reached by the epidemic wave. Here we provide the reproduction number estimation both in space and in time from February 24 to April 24, 2020 over 2 months into the epidemic. Methods: The aim of the present work was to provide a systematical mapping of the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics spread to all regions of Italy. To do so, we estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), by using the maximum likelihood estimation method in the early stage of the epidemic. In addition, we determined time evolution of this parameter across the 2 months of the observational period. Finally, we linked R t , with two indices, the first representing the number of contagious people and the latter the density of susceptibiltiy to infection of people in a region as recorded on April 24, 2020. Results: Our estimates suggest a basic reproduction number averaged over all the regions of 3.29. Based on the SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics reported here, we gave a quantitative evaluation of the efficiency of the government measures to lower the reproduction number below 1 (control regime). We estimated that the worst-hit regions in Italy reached the control regime level (R t < 1) in about a month. Conclusion: Our work was carried out in the period between April and July,2020. We found that the mean value of time to reach the control regime across the whole country was about 31 days from February 24, 2020. Moreover, we highlighted the interplay between the reproduction number and two epidemiological/demographic indices to evaluate the \"state of activity\" of the epidemic, potentially helping in challenging decisions to continue, ease, or tighten restrictions.

Africa has been described as one of the most vulnerable region with the COVID-19 infection during the initial phase of the outbreak, due to the fact that Africa is a great commercial partner of China and some other EU and American countries. Which result in large volume of travels by traders to the region more frequently and causing African countries face even bigger health threat during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the fact that the control and management of COVID-19 pandemic rely heavily on a country's health care system, and on average Africa has poor health care system which make it more vulnerable indicating a need for timely intervention to curtail the spread. In this paper, we estimate the exponential growth rate and basic reproduction number (R0) of COVID-19 in Africa to show the potential of the virus to spread, and reveal the importance of sustaining stringent health measures to control the disease in Africa. METHODS: We analyzed the initial phase of the epidemic of COVID-19 in Africa between 1 March and 13 April 2020, by using the simple exponential growth model. We examined the publicly available materials published by the WHO situation report to show the potential of COVID-19 to spread without sustaining strict health measures. The Poisson likelihood framework is adopted for data fitting and parameter estimation. We modelled the distribution of COVID-19 generation interval (GI) as Gamma distributions with a mean of 4.7 days and standard deviation of 2.9 days estimated from previous work, and compute the basic reproduction number. RESULTS: We estimated the exponential growth rate as 0.22 per day (95% CI: 0.20-0.24), and the basic reproduction number, R0, as 2.37 (95% CI: 2.22-2.51) based on the assumption that the exponential growth starting from 1 March 2020. With an R0 at 2.37, we quantified the instantaneous transmissibility of the outbreak by the time-varying effective reproductive number to show the potential of COVID-19 to spread across African region. CONCLUSIONS: The initial growth of COVID-19 cases in Africa was rapid and showed large variations across countries.

It consists in reducing social interactions. This is taken into account by the introduction of a factor of reduction of social interactions q, and by decreasing the transmission coefficient of the disease accordingly. Evaluating q is a difficult question and one can ask if it makes sense to compute an average coefficient q for a given population, in order to make predictions on the basic reproduction rate R0, the dynamics of the epidemic or the fraction of the population that will have been infected by the end of the epidemic. On a very simple example, we show that the computation of R0 in a heterogeneous population is not reduced to the computation of an average q but rather to the direct computation of an average coefficient R0. Even more interesting is the fact that, in a range of data compatible with the Covid-19 outbreak, the size of the epidemic is deeply modified by social heterogeneity, as is the height of the epidemic peak, while the date at which it is reached mainly depends on the average R0 coefficient.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Although in the case of uniform lockdown, a simple compartmental model would indicate instantaneous transition to decay of the epidemic, this is not the case when partially isolated active clusters remain with the potential to create a series of small outbreaks. We model this using the Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm based on a connected set of stochastic susceptible-infected-removed/recovered networks representing the locked-down majority population (in which the reproduction number is less than 1) weakly coupled to a large set of small clusters in which the infection may propagate. We find that the presence of such active clusters can lead to slower than expected decay of the epidemic and significantly delayed onset of the decay phase. We study the relative contributions of these changes, caused by the active clusters within the population, to the additional total infected population. We also demonstrate that limiting the size of the inevitable active clusters can be efficient in reducing their impact on the overall size of the epidemic outbreak.

The possible ideal strategy of testing each patient before each shift with RT-PCR was not feasible. We aimed to study the effectiveness of fortnightly screening with RT -PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in curbing transmission. METHOD: Between July 1, 2020, and September 30, 2020, all 273 patients receiving hemodialysis were subjected to fortnightly testing for SARS-Cov-2 in the unit to detect asymptomatic patients. The cost and effectiveness of universal testing in preventing transmission were analyzed using Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) modeling assuming R0 of 2.2. RESULTS: Of 273 MHD patients, 55 (20.1%) got infected with SARS-CoV-2 over three months. Six (10.9%) were symptomatic, and 49 (89.1%) asymptomatic at the time of testing. Six (10.9%) asymptomatic patients develop symptoms later; and 43 (78.2%) remained asymptomatic. A total of 7(6.1%) HCWs also tested positive for the virus. With an assumption of R0 2.2 and isolation of symptomatic patients only, all 273 patients could have been affected by September 30, 2020; with the isolation of both symptomatic patients and those testing positive after pre-dialysis screen, only 52 (19%) infections could have been prevented. However, at the end of the study period, 218 (80%) patients remained uninfected of SARS-CoV-2. Fortnightly universal testing is cost-effective, and SIR modeling proved effective in preventing person-to-person transmission. CONCLUSION: Repeated universal testing in maintenance hemodialysis patients detected 89% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients over three months and appeared to be an effective strategy to prevent person-to-person transmission in the dialysis unit.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In contrast to state-of-the-art alternatives such as Approximate Bayesian Computation techniques, no forward simulation of the model is required and there are no tuning parameters. Evaluating the approximate marginal likelihood of model parameters is achieved through a computationally simple filtering recursion. The accuracy of the approximation is demonstrated through analysis of real and simulated data using a model of the 1995 Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

New LSD outbreaks are currently circulating in the Middle East (ME). Since 2012, severe outbreaks were reported in cattle across the region. Characterizing the spatial and temporal dynamics of LSDV in cattle populations is prerequisite for guiding successful surveillance and control efforts at a regional level in the ME. Here, we aim to model the ecological niche of LSDV and identify epidemic progression patterns over the course of the epidemic. We analyzed publically available outbreak data from the ME for the period 2012\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 using presence-only maximum entropy ecological niche modeling and the time-dependent method for the estimation of the effective reproductive number (R-TD). High-risk areas (probability >0.60) for LSDV identified by ecological niche modeling included parts of many northeastern ME countries, though Israel and Turkey were estimated to be the most suitable locations for occurrence of LSDV outbreaks. The most important environmental predictors that contributed to the ecological niche of LSDV included annual precipitation, land cover, mean diurnal range, type of livestock production system, and global livestock densities. Average monthly effective R-TD was equal to 2.2 (95% CI: 1.2, 3.5), whereas the largest R-TD was estimated in Israel (R-TD = 22.2, 95 CI: 15.2, 31.5) in September 2013, which indicated that the demographic and environmental conditions during this period were suitable to LSDV super-spreading events.

More epidemiological information related to cattle populations are needed to further improve the inferred spatial and temporal characteristics of currently circulating LSDV. However, the methodology presented here may be useful in guiding the design of risk-based surveillance and control programs in the region as well as aid in the formulation of epidemic preparedness plans in neighboring LSDV-free countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We used a branching process model to derive the final size distribution of minor outbreaks, assuming a reproduction number above unity, and applying the method to final size data for pneumonic plague. Pneumonic plague is a rare disease with only one documented major epidemic in a spatially limited setting. Because the final size distribution of a minor outbreak needs to be normalized by the probability of extinction, we assume that the dispersion parameter (k) of the negative-binomial offspring distribution is known, and examine the sensitivity of the reproduction number to variation in dispersion. Assuming a geometric offspring distribution with k = 1, the reproduction number was estimated at 1.16 (95% confidence interval: 0.97\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.38). When less dispersed with k = 2, the maximum likelihood estimate of the reproduction number was 1.14. These estimates agreed with those published from transmission network analysis, indicating that the human-to-human transmission potential of the pneumonic plague is not very high. Given only minor outbreaks, transmission potential is not sufficiently assessed by directly counting the number of offspring. Since the absence of a major epidemic does not guarantee a subcritical process, the proposed method allows us to conservatively regard epidemic data from minor outbreaks as supercritical, and yield estimates of threshold values above unity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

While isolating asymptomatic cases will be necessary to effectively control viral spread, these cases are functionally invisible and there is no current method to identify them for isolation. To address this major omission in COVID-19 control, we develop a strategy, Sampling-Testing-Quarantine (STQ), for identifying and isolating individuals with asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 in order to mitigate the epidemic. STQ uses probability sampling in the general population, regardless of symptoms, then isolates the individuals who test positive along with their household members who are high probability for asymptomatic infections. To test the potential efficacy of STQ, we use an agent-based model, designed to computationally simulate the epidemic in the Seattle with infection parameters, like R0 and asymptomatic fraction, derived from population data. Our results suggest that STQ can substantially slow and decrease the spread of COVID-19, even in the absence of school and work shutdowns.

The objective of this study was to estimate the R0 and CFR of COVID-19 and assess whether the parameters vary in different regions of the world. We carried out a systematic review to retrieve the published estimates of the R0 and the CFR in articles from international databases between 1st January and 31st August 2020.

Furthermore, the R0 and CFR of the studies were quantified based on geographic location, the tests/thousand population, and the median population age of the countries where studies were conducted. The I2 statistic and the Cochran's Q test were applied to assess statistical heterogeneity among the selected studies. Forty-five studies involving R0 and thirty-four studies involving CFR were included. The pooled estimation of the R0 was 2.69 (95% CI: 2.40, 2.98), and that of the CFR was 2.67 (2.25, 3.13).

However, the R0 did not vary significantly in different regions of the world. An R0 of 2.69 and CFR of 2.67 indicate the severity of the COVID-19.

R(t) reflects the epidemic dynamics based on readily available illness onset data, and is useful for the planning and implementation of public health and social measures. In the present study, we proposed a method for computing the R(t) of COVID-19, and applied this method to the epidemic in Osaka prefecture from February to September 2020. We estimated R(t) as a function of the time of infection using the date of illness onset. The epidemic in Osaka came under control around 2 April during the first wave, and 26 July during the second wave. R(t) did not decline drastically following any single intervention. However, when multiple interventions were combined, the relative reductions in R(t) during the first and second waves were 70% and 51%, respectively. Although the second wave was brought under control without declaring a state of emergency, our model comparison indicated that relying on a single intervention would not be sufficient to reduce R(t) < 1. The outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to rely on political leadership to swiftly design and implement combined interventions capable of broadly and appropriately reducing contacts.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We examine the effects of these interventions, based on modeling of the unfolding epidemic. We test modeling options of the spatially explicit type, suggested by the wave of infections spreading from the initial foci to the rest of Italy. We estimate parameters of a metacommunity Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR)-like transmission model that includes a network of 107 provinces connected by mobility at high resolution, and the critical contribution of presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. We estimate a generalized reproduction number ([Formula: see text] = 3.60 [3.49 to 3.84]), the spectral radius of a suitable next-generation matrix that measures the potential spread in the absence of containment interventions. The model includes the implementation of progressive restrictions after the first case confirmed in Italy (February 21, 2020) and runs until March 25, 2020. We account for uncertainty in epidemiological reporting, and time dependence of human mobility matrices and awareness-dependent exposure probabilities. We draw scenarios of different containment measures and their impact. Results suggest that the sequence of restrictions posed to mobility and human-to-human interactions have reduced transmission by 45% (42 to 49%). Averted hospitalizations are measured by running scenarios obtained by selectively relaxing the imposed restrictions and total about 200,000 individuals (as of March 25, 2020). Although a number of assumptions need to be reexamined, like age structure in social mixing patterns and in the distribution of mobility, hospitalization, and fatality, we conclude that verifiable evidence exists to support the planning of emergency measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this paper, we identify a number of characteristic features of influenza incidence time series in temperate regions, including ranges of annual attack rates and outbreak durations. By constraining the output of simple models to match these characteristic features, we investigate the role played by population heterogeneity, multiple strains, cross-immunity and the rate of strain evolution in the generation of incidence time series. Results indicate that an age-structured model with non-random mixing and co-circulating strains are both required to match observed time-series data. Our work gives estimates of the seasonal peak basic reproduction number, R(0), in the range 1.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533. Estimates of R(0) are strongly correlated with the timescale for waning of immunity to current circulating seasonal influenza strain, which we estimate is between 3 and 8 years.

We found that a time-varying vaccination program (i.e., allocating vaccines to different target groups as the epidemic evolves) can be highly beneficial as it is capable of simultaneously achieving different objectives (e.g., minimizing the number of deaths and of infections).

Hospitals become rapidly overwhelmed when patients requiring life-saving support outpace available capacities. OBJECTIVE: We describe methods used by a university hospital to forecast case loads and time to peak incidence. METHODS: We developed a set of models to forecast incidence among the hospital catchment population and to describe the COVID-19 patient hospital-care pathway. The first forecast utilized data from antecedent allopatric epidemics and parameterized the care-pathway model according to expert opinion (ie, the static model). Once sufficient local data were available, trends for the time-dependent effective reproduction number were fitted, and the care pathway was reparameterized using hazards for real patient admission, referrals, and discharge (ie, the dynamic model). RESULTS: The static model, deployed before the epidemic, exaggerated the bed occupancy for general wards (116 forecasted vs 66 observed), ICUs (47 forecasted vs 34 observed), and predicted the peak too late: general ward forecast April 9 and observed April 8 and ICU forecast April 19 and observed April 8. After April 5, the dynamic model could be run daily, and its precision improved with increasing availability of empirical local data. CONCLUSIONS: The models provided data-based guidance for the preparation and allocation of critical resources of a university hospital well in advance of the epidemic surge, despite overestimating the service demand. Overestimates should resolve when the population contact pattern before and during restrictions can be taken into account, but for now they may provide an acceptable safety margin for preparing during times of uncertainty.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: Data on COVID-19 cases in China up to 20 March 2020 was collected from epidemiological investigations or official websites. Data on SARS cases in Guangdong Province, Beijing, and Hong Kong during 2002\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533 was also obtained. We estimated the doubling time, basic reproduction number (R(0)), and time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of COVID-19 and SARS. RESULTS: As of 20 March 2020, 80,739 locally acquired COVID-19 cases were identified in mainland China, with most cases reported between 20 January and 29 February 2020. The R(0) value of COVID-19 in China and Wuhan was 5.0 and 4.8, respectively, which was greater than the R(0) value of SARS in Guangdong (R(0) = 2.3), Hong Kong (R(0) = 2.3), and Beijing (R(0) = 2.6). At the start of the COVID-19 epidemic, the R(t) value in China peaked at 8.4 and then declined quickly to below 1.0 in one month. With SARS, the R(t) curve saw fluctuations with more than one peak, the highest peak was lower than that for COVID-19.

In this paper we present a stochastic compartmental model capable of real-time monitoring and forecasting of the pandemic incorporating multiple streams of real-world data, reported cases, testing intensity, deaths, hospitalisations and critical care occupancy. Model parameters are estimated via a Bayesian particle filtering technique. The model successfully tracks the key variables (reported cases, critical care and deaths) throughout the two waves (March-June and September-November 2020) of the COVID-19 outbreak in Scotland. The model hospitalisation predictions in Summer 2020 are consistently lower than the recorded data, but consistent with the change to the reporting criteria by the Health Protection Scotland on 15th September. Most parameter estimates were constant over the two waves, but the infection rate and consequently the reproductive number decrease in the later stages of the first wave and increase again from July 2020. The death rates are initially high but decrease over Summer 2020 before rising again in November. The model can also be used to provide short-term predictions. We show that the 2-week predictability is very good for the period from March to June 2020, even at early stages of the pandemic. The model has been slower to pick up the increase in the case numbers in September 2020 but forecasting improves again in the later stages of the epidemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Insights from mixing matrices and mathematical models.\nAustralia is one of a few countries which has managed to control COVID-19 epidemic before a major epidemic took place. Currently with just under 7000 cases and 100 deaths, Australia is seeing less than 20 new cases per day. This is a positive outcome, but makes estimation of current effective reproduction numbers difficult to estimate. Australia, like much of the world is poised to step out of lockdown and looking at which measures to relax first. We use age-based contact matrices, calibrated to Chinese data on reproduction numbers and difference in infectiousness and susceptibility of children to generate next generation matrices (NGMs) for Australia. These matrices have a spectral radius of 2.49, which is hence our estimated basic reproduction number for Australia. The effective reproduction number (Reff) for Australia during the April/May lockdown period is estimated by other means to be around 0.8. We simulate the impact of lockdown on the NGM by first applying observations through Google Mobility Report for Australia at 3 locations: home (increased contacts by 18%), work (reduced contacts by 34%) and other (reduced contacts by 40%), and we reduce schools to 3% reflecting attendance rates during lockdown. Applying macro-distancing to the NGM leads to a spectral radius of 1.76. We estimate that the further reduction of the reproduction number to current levels of Reff = 0.8 is achieved by a micro-distancing factor of 0.26. That is, in a given location, people are 26% as likely as usual to have an effective contact with another person. We apply both macro and micro-distancing to the NGMs to examine the impact of different exit strategies. We find that reopening schools is estimated to reduce Reff from 0.8 to 0.78. This is because increase in school contact is offset by decrease in home contact. The NGMs all estimate that adults aged 30-50 are responsible for the majority of transmission. We also find that micro-distancing is critically important to maintain Reff <1. There is considerable uncertainty in these estimates and a sensitivity and uncertainty analysis is presented.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this combined mathematical and phylogenetic study of observational data, we aimed to find out the extent to which the resurgent epidemic is the result of newly introduced strains or of growth of already circulating strains. METHODS AND FINDINGS: As of November 2011, the ATHENA observational HIV cohort of all patients in care in the Netherlands since 1996 included HIV-1 subtype B polymerase sequences from 5,852 patients. Patients who were diagnosed between 1981 and 1995 were included in the cohort if they were still alive in 1996. The ten most similar sequences to each ATHENA sequence were selected from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, and a phylogenetic tree was created of a total of 8,320 sequences. Large transmission clusters that included \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a510 ATHENA sequences were selected, with a local support value \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a5 0.9 and median pairwise patristic distance below the fifth percentile of distances in the whole tree. Time-varying reproduction numbers of the large MSM-majority clusters were estimated through mathematical modeling. We identified 106 large transmission clusters, including 3,061 (52%) ATHENA and 652 Los Alamos sequences. Half of the HIV sequences from MSM registered in the cohort in the Netherlands (2,128 of 4,288) were included in 91 large MSM-majority clusters. Strikingly, at least 54 (59%) of these 91 MSM-majority clusters were already circulating before 1996, when cART was introduced, and have persisted to the present. Overall, 1,226 (35%) of the 3,460 diagnoses among MSM since 1996 were found in these 54 long-standing clusters. The reproduction numbers of all large MSM-majority clusters were around the epidemic threshold value of one over the whole study period. A tendency towards higher numbers was visible in recent years, especially in the more recently introduced clusters. The mean age of MSM at diagnosis increased by 0.45 years/year within clusters, but new clusters appeared with lower mean age. Major strengths of this study are the high proportion of HIV-positive MSM with a sequence in this study and the combined application of phylogenetic and modeling approaches. Main limitations are the assumption that the sampled population is representative of the overall HIV-positive population and the assumption that the diagnosis interval distribution is similar between clusters. CONCLUSIONS: The resurgent HIV epidemic amongst MSM in the Netherlands is driven by several large, persistent, self-sustaining, and, in many cases, growing sub-epidemics shifting towards new generations of MSM. Many of the sub-epidemics have been present since the early epidemic, to which new sub-epidemics are being added.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: Any individual who tested positive for COVID-19 was classified as a confirmed case. Measures were taken to identify the source of infection and trace and quarantine contacts. Serial intervals were estimated and the effective reproduction number was computed. RESULTS: Of the total 18,303 COVID-19 tests performed between January 16, 2020 and March 24, 2020 in Busan, 108 yielded positive results (positive test rate, 0.6%). All confirmed cases were placed in isolation at hospitals. Of the 108 confirmed cases, 59 (54.6%) were female. The most common age group was 20-29 years with 37 cases (34.3%). Regarding symptoms at the time of diagnosis, cough (n=38, 35.2%) and fever (n=34, 31.5%) were most common; 12 cases (11.1%) were asymptomatic. The source of infection was identified in 99 cases (91.7%). A total of 3,223 contacts were identified and quarantined. Household contacts accounted for 196, and the household secondary attack rate was 8.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.7 to 12.9). The mean serial interval was estimated to be 5.54 days (95% CI, 4.08 to 7.01). After February 26, (R(t)) remained below 1 in Busan. CONCLUSIONS: The early containment strategy implemented in Busan shows that control is possible if outbreaks are of limited scope. In preparation for future outbreaks, public health and healthcare systems should be re-examined and put in a ready state.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We present estimates of the basic reproduction number, R(0), of 2019-nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak. METHODS: Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate, we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019-nCoV cases time series, in mainland China from January 10 to January 24, 2020, through the exponential growth. With the estimated intrinsic growth rate (\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3), we estimated R(0) by using the serial intervals (SI) of two other well-known coronavirus diseases, MERS and SARS, as approximations for the true unknown SI. FINDINGS: The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth. We estimated that the mean R(0) ranges from 2.24 (95%CI: 1.96\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.55) to 3.58 (95%CI: 2.89\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.39) associated with 8-fold to 2-fold increase in the reporting rate. We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R(0). CONCLUSION: The mean estimate of R(0) for the 2019-nCoV ranges from 2.24 to 3.58, and is significantly larger than 1.

Our approach is based on a mathematical model which tracks the spread of disease among different age groups and across different geographical regions, and we introduce a method to combine age-specific contact data to geographical movement data. As a case study, we model the epidemic in the population of mainland Finland utilizing mobility data from a major telecom operator. Our approach allows to determine which geographical regions and age groups should be targeted first in order to minimize the number of deaths. In the scenarios that we test, we find that distributing vaccines demographically and in an age-descending order is not optimal for minimizing deaths and the burden of disease. Instead, more lives could be saved by using strategies which emphasize high-incidence regions and distribute vaccines in parallel to multiple age groups. The level of emphasis that high-incidence regions should be given depends on the overall transmission rate in the population. This observation highlights the importance of updating the vaccination strategy when the effective reproduction number changes due to the general contact patterns changing and new virus variants entering.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

A series of intervention strategies have been implemented, but didn't stop its spread. Methods: Two mathematical models have been developed to simulate the current epidemic situation in the city of Wuhan and in other parts of China. Special considerations were given to the mobility of people for the estimation and forecast the number of asymptomatic infections, symptomatic infections, and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse). Findings: The basic reproductive number (R0) was calculated for the period between 18 January 2020 and 16 February 2020: R0 declined from 5.75 to 1.69 in Wuhan and from 6.22 to 1.67 in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area). At the same time, Wuhan is estimated to observe a peak in the number of confirmed cases around 6 February 2020. The number of infected individuals in the entire country (not including the Wuhan area) peaked around February 3. The results also show that the peak of new asymptomatic cases per day in Wuhan occurred on February 6, and the peak of new symptomatic infections have occurred on February 3. Concurrently, while the number of confirmed cases nationwide would continue to decline, the number of real-time COVID-19 inpatients in Wuhan has reached a peak of 13,030 on February 14 before it decreases. The model further shows that the COVID-19 cases will gradually wane by the end of April 2020, both in Wuhan and the other parts of China. The number of confirmed cases would reach the single digit on March 27 in Wuhan and March 19 in the entire country. The five cities with top risk index in China with the exclusion of Wuhan are: Huanggang, Xiaogan, Jingzhou, Chongqing, and Xiangyang city. Interpretations: Although the national peak time has been reached, a significant proportion of asymptomatic patients and the infections of super-spreading events (Isse) still exist in the population, indicating the potential difficulty for the prevention and control of the disease. As the Return-to-Work tide is approaching and upgrading, further measures (e.g., escalatory quarantine, mask wearing when going out, and sit apart when taking vehicles) will be particularly crucial to stop the COVID-19 in other cities outside of Wuhan.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Italy has now become the most hit country outside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a total of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In the context of an emerging infectious disease outbreak, it is of paramount importance to predict the trend of the epidemic in order to plan an effective control strategy and to determine its impact. This paper proposes a new epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on whether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The distinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because non-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than diagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain misperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic phenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop life-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires hospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the healthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be redefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic containment. Simulation results are compared with real data on the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, to show the validity of the model and compare different possible predicted scenarios depending on the adopted countermeasures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Oman has implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. However, responses to NPIs may be different across different populations within a country with a large number of migrants, such as Oman. This study investigated the different responses to NPIs, and assessed the use of the time-varying reproduction number (Rt) to monitor them. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 data for Oman, from February 24 to June 3, 2020, were used alongside demographic and epidemiological information. Data were arranged into pairs of infector-infectee, and two main libraries of R software were used to estimate reproductive number (Rt). Rt was calculated for both Omanis and non-Omanis. FINDINGS: A total of 13,538 cases were included, 44.9% of which were Omanis. Among all these cases we identified 2769 infector-infectee pairs for calculating Rt. There was a sharp drop in Rt from 3.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.8-4.6) in mid-March to 1.4 (95% CI 1.2-1.7) in late March in response to NPIs. Rt then decreased further to 1.2 (95% CI 1.1-1.3) in late April after which it rose, corresponding to the easing of NPIs. Comparing the two groups, the response to major public health controls was more evident in Omanis in reducing Rt to 1.09 (95% CI 0.84-1.3) by the end of March. INTERPRETATION: Use of real-time estimation of Rt allowed us to follow the effects of NPIs.

In this paper, we employ an SEIR-based compartmental model to study the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks in Nigeria. The model incorporates a different group of populations (that is high- and- moderate risk populations) and is used to investigate the influence on each population on the overall transmission dynamics.The model, which is fitted well to the data, is qualitatively analyzed to evaluate the impacts of different schemes for controlstrategies. Mathematical analysis reveals that the model has two equilibria; i.e., disease-free equilibrium (DFE) which is local asymptotic stability (LAS) if the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) is less than 1; and unstable for R 0 > 1 , and an endemic equilibrium (EE) which is globally asymptotic stability (LAS) whenever R 0 > 1 .Furthermore, we find that the model undergoes a phenomenon of backward bifurcation (BB, a coexistence of stable DFE and stable EE even if the R 0 < 1 ). We employ Partial Rank Correlation coefficients for sensitivity analyses to evaluate the model's parameters. Our results highlight that proper surveillance, more especially movement of individuals from high risk to moderate risk population, testing, as well as imposing other NPIs measures are vital strategies for mitigating the COVID-19 epidemic in Nigeria.Besides, in the absence of an exact solution for the proposed model, we solve the model with the well-known ODE45 numerical solver and the effective numerical schemes such as Euler (EM), Runge-Kutta of order 2 (RK-2), and Runge-Kutta of order 4 (RK-4) in order to establish approximate solutions and to show the physical features of the model.

The absence of immunity, presymptomatic transmission, and the relatively high level of virulence of the COVID-19 infection led to a massive flow of patients in intensive care units (ICU). This unprecedented situation calls for rapid and accurate mathematical models to best inform public health policies. We develop an original parsimonious discrete-time model that accounts for the effect of the age of infection on the natural history of the disease. Analysing the ongoing COVID-19 in France as a test case, through the publicly available time series of nationwide hospital mortality and ICU activity, we estimate the value of the key epidemiological parameters and the impact of lock-down implementation delay. This work shows that including memory-effects in the modelling of COVID-19 spreading greatly improves the accuracy of the fit to the epidemiological data. We estimate that the epidemic wave in France started on Jan 20 [Jan 12, Jan 28] (95% likelihood interval) with a reproduction number initially equal to 2.99 [2.59, 3.39], which was reduced by the national lock-down started on Mar 17 to 24 [21, 27] of its value. We also estimate that the implementation of the latter a week earlier or later would have lead to a difference of about respectively -13k and +50k hospital deaths by the end of lock-down.

                "prompt": "Research on the Applications of Calcium Propionate in Dairy Cows: A Review\nSIMPLE SUMMARY: In modern dairy cattle production systems, the mycotoxins in feed and metabolic disease, such as ketosis and milk fever, seriously affect the health and milk production of dairy cows. Calcium propionate is a safe and reliable food and additive that is widely used. It can be employed in silage and total mixed rations (TMR) against mycotoxin production. In the perinatal period, many cows cannot adjust to the tremendous metabolic, endocrine, and physiological changes, resulting in ketosis and fatty liver due to a negative energy balance or milk fever induced by hypocalcemia, which damages their health and reduces the production performance. Studies have revealed that calcium propionate can play an active role in solving these problems. It can also regulate rumen development in calves. This paper reviews the recent research progress regarding the application of calcium propionate in dairy cows and dairy calves. The key findings and mechanisms are summarized and potential further studies are suggested. ABSTRACT: Calcium propionate is a safe and reliable food and feed additive. It can be metabolized and absorbed by humans and animals as a precursor for glucose synthesis. In addition, calcium propionate provides essential calcium to mammals. In the perinatal period of dairy cows, many cows cannot adjust to the tremendous metabolic, endocrine, and physiological changes, resulting in ketosis and fatty liver due to a negative energy balance (NEB) or milk fever induced by hypocalcemia. On hot weather days, cow feed (TMR or silage) is susceptible to mildew, which produces mycotoxins. These two issues are closely related to dairy health and performance. Perinatal period metabolic disease significantly reduces cow production and increases the elimination rate because it causes major glucose and calcium deficiencies. Feeding a diet contaminated with mycotoxin leads to rumen metabolic disorders, a reduced reproductive rate (increased abortion rate), an increased number of milk somatic cells, and decreased milk production, as well as an increased occurrence of mastitis and hoof disease. Propionic acid is the primary gluconeogenic precursor in dairy cows and one of the safest mold inhibitors. Therefore, calcium propionate, which can be hydrolyzed into propionic acid and Ca(2+) in the rumen, may be a good feed additive for alleviating NEB and milk fever in the perinatal period of dairy cows. It can also be used to inhibit TMR or silage deterioration in hot weather and regulate rumen development in calves. This paper reviews the application of calcium propionate in dairy cows.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We used the Wells-Riley mathematical model to estimate (1) the CO2 exposure concentrations in indoor environments where cases of inhalation airborne infection occurred based on reported epidemiological data and epidemic curves for influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), (2) the basic reproductive number, R0 (i.e., expected number of secondary cases on the introduction of a single infected individual in a completely susceptible population) and its variability in a shared indoor airspace, and (3) the risk for infection in various scenarios of exposure in a susceptible population for a range of R0. We also employ a standard susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) structure to relate Wells-Riley model derived R0 to a transmission parameter to implicate the relationships between indoor carbon dioxide concentration and contact rate. We estimate that a single case of SARS will infect 2.6 secondary cases on average in a population from nosocomial transmission, whereas less than 1 secondary infection was generated per case among school children. We also obtained an estimate of the basic reproductive number for influenza in a commercial airliner: the median value is 10.4. We suggest that improving the building air cleaning rate to lower the critical rebreathed fraction of indoor air can decrease transmission rate. Here, we show that virulence of the organism factors, infectious quantum generation rates (quanta/s by an infected person), and host factors determine the risk for inhalation of indoor airborne infection.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Newly-developed methods for real-time approximations (Rt) offer promise for monitoring COVID-19 trends using real-world data. The objective was to compare available methods of calculating Rt and understand drivers in variability, using available regional public surveillance data. Methods: Longitudinal public health data describing infections, recoveries, and deaths from New Jersey (NJ), British Columbia (BC), and Ontario were visualized. Two methods for calculating Rt, by Cori et al. (growth in cases) and Contreras et al. (cases, recoveries, deaths), were implemented and compared. The sensitivity of estimated Rt parameter to changes in infection rates, duration of infection, and mortality rates was investigated, and the relationship with public health measures explored visually. Results: Rates of COVID-19 infections per 100,000 residents from May to December ranged from 2,856 (NJ) to 622 (BC), and total cases ranged from 253,696 (NJ) to 31,782 (BC). Using Cori et al. method, Rt estimates ranged from 0.5 to 1.5 across jurisdictions;even with large rises in incidence, estimates remained relatively stable. In contrast, Rt estimates based on Contreras et al. markedly fluctuated. Estimates for BC and Ontario were generally 0.5 to 3, but exceeded 10 for NJ for much of the observation period due to limited reporting of recoveries. Conclusions: Rt estimates for COVID-19, calculated using two recent methods, vary;and each method considers different parameters in its derivation. The Cori et al. method may be better suited to tracking COVID-19 burden in jurisdictions with incomplete recovery data reported;the choice of measure should depend on accuracy and timing of the reporting of required metrics. Accurate estimates and visualizations of Rt will be informative for understanding changing COVID-19 burden and comparing the impact of interventions across jurisdictions.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Also, it signifies the importance of the disease to the community. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran and its different provinces. Methods: This study was conducted on the data of COVID-19 patients in Iran from February 21 to March 8, 2020. To determine the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran, the serial interval and \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 value were first determined using linear regression analysis. Then, the net reproductive number values were calculated for Iran and its different provinces. Results: The results of this study showed that the net reproductive number of COVID-19 in Iran was 1.31. Using the available data up to March 15, 2020, the highest net reproductive number was in Mazandaran, Yazd, Isfahan, Qazvin, and Zanjan provinces, with values of 2.07, 1.86, 1.84, and 1.76, respectively. The net reproductive number also showed an increasing trend in Kohgiluyeh and Boyer-Ahmad province. Conclusion: It seems that although the net reproductive number of the virus had a decreasing trend in the provinces, it is still high. Therefore, sanitary measures in these provinces should be pursued more seriously. On the other hand, social distancing is a topic that should be taken into consideration, that is, social gatherings and contacts should be avoided as much as possible and strategies and facilities for this action should be developed by the government and health policymakers.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Growing evidence suggests transmission may be characterized by extensive individual heterogeneity in secondary cases (i.e., superspreading), yet the degree and influence of such heterogeneity is largely unknown and unmeasured in high burden-settings. We conducted a prospective, population-based molecular epidemiology study of TB transmission in both an urban and rural setting of Botswana, one of the highest TB burden countries in the world. We used these empirical data to fit two mathematical models (urban and rural) that jointly quantified both the effective reproductive number, [Formula: see text] , and the propensity for superspreading in each population. We found both urban and rural populations were characterized by a high degree of individual heterogeneity, however such heterogeneity disproportionately impacted the rural population: 99% of secondary transmission was attributed to only 19% of infectious cases in the rural population compared to 60% in the urban population and the median number of incident cases until the first outbreak of 30 cases was only 32 for the rural model compared to 791 in the urban model. These findings suggest individual heterogeneity plays a critical role shaping local TB epidemiology within subpopulations.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Many of the analyses to date have involved fitting predictions from a transmission model to the observed epidemic curves from different settings. METHODS Using morbidity data from cities in Europe and America and from confined settings during the 1918 influenza pandemic, we contrast the use of several different methods based on the growth rate and final size of the epidemic, which do not rely on transmission models, to estimate the effective and basic reproduction numbers. RESULTS The effective reproduction number (the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by a typical infectious case in a given population) for the 1918 influenza virus was in the range 1.2-3.0 and 2.1-7.5 for community-based and confined settings, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Assuming further that 30 and 50% of individuals were immune to Spanish influenza after the wave in April 1918 and the first subsequent wave, respectively, these findings imply that, in a totally susceptible population, an infectious case could have led to 2.4-4.3 and 2.6-10.6 cases in community-based and confined settings, respectively. These findings for community-based populations confirm the relatively low transmissibility of the 1918 (Spanish) influenza virus, which has been found by other studies using alternative data sources and methods.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

DESIGN: This paper presents the first results from this group, which is a molecular epidemiological study of the first 21 SARS-CoV-2 whole genomes sampled in the first port of entry - KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) - during the first month of the epidemic. By combining this with calculations of the effective reproduction number (R), it aimed to shed light on the patterns of infections in South Africa. RESULTS: Two of the largest provinces - Gauteng and KZN - had a slow growth rate for the number of detected cases, while the epidemic spread faster in the Western Cape and Eastern Cape. The estimates of transmission potential suggested a decrease towards R = 1 since the first cases and deaths, but a subsequent estimated R average of 1.39 between 6-18 May 2020. It was also demonstrated that early transmission in KZN was associated with multiple international introductions and dominated by lineages B1 and B. Evidence for locally acquired infections in a hospital in Durban within the first month of the epidemic was also provided. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa was very heterogeneous in its spatial dimension, with many distinct introductions of SARS-CoV2 in KZN and evidence of nosocomial transmission, which inflated early mortality in KZN. The epidemic at the local level was still developing and NGS-SA aimed to clarify the dynamics in South Africa and devise the most effective measures as the outbreak evolved.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this paper, we develop the variational Bayesian skyline (VBSKY), a method for fitting Bayesian phylodynamic models to very large pathogen genetic data sets. By combining recent advances in phylodynamic modeling, scalable Bayesian inference and differentiable programming, along with a few tailored heuristics, VBSKY is capable of analyzing thousands of genomes in a few minutes, providing accurate estimates of epidemiologically relevant quantities such as the effective reproduction number and overall sampling effort through time.

For illustration, we make use of the Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) mortality data and vaccination data of the very young (age 0-2) and the very old (age >64) during 2004-2005 Taiwan winter influenza season to fit our model and to compute the relevant reproduction numbers. The reproduction number for this winter flu season is estimated to be slightly above one (~1.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Comparatively large errors in fitting the P&I mortality data of the elderly (>64) were observed shortly after winter school closings in January, which may indicate the impact of younger, more active age groups transmitting influenza to other age groups outside of the school settings; in particular, to the elderly in the households. Pre-symptomatic infections seemed to have little effect on the model fit, while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronounced impact on the model fit for the elderly mortality, perhaps indicating a larger role in disease transmission by asymptomatic infection. Simulations indicate that the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with interventions, but could still be substantial. The estimated per contact transmission probability for susceptible elderly is significantly higher than that of any other age group, perhaps highlighting the vulnerability of the elderly due to close contacts with their caretakers from other age groups. The relative impact of targeting the very young and the very old for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating these two groups on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. This further underscores the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent elderly mortality.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This study explores the role of age in potentially driving differentials in infection spread, epidemic potential, and rates of disease severity and mortality across countries. An age-stratified deterministic mathematical model that describes SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics was applied to 159 countries and territories with a population \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a51 million. Assuming worst-case scenario for the pandemic, the results indicate that there could be stark regional differences in epidemic trajectories driven by differences in the distribution of the population by age. In the African Region (median age: 18.9 years), the median R(0) was 1.05 versus 2.05 in the European Region (median age: 41.7 years), and the median (per 100 persons) for the final cumulative infection incidence was 22.5 (versus 69.0), for severe and/or critical disease cases rate was 3.3 (versus 13.0), and for death rate was 0.5 (versus 3.9). Age could be a driver of variable SARS-CoV-2 epidemic trajectories worldwide. Countries with sizable adult and/or elderly populations and smaller children populations may experience large and rapid epidemics in absence of interventions. Meanwhile, countries with predominantly younger age cohorts may experience smaller and slower epidemics. These predictions, however, should not lead to complacency, as the pandemic could still have a heavy toll nearly everywhere.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The basic reproduction number, which has been widely used and misused to characterize the transmissibility of the virus, hides the fact that transmission is stochastic, is dominated by a small number of individuals, and is driven by super-spreading events (SSEs). The distinct transmission features, such as high stochasticity under low prevalence, and the central role played by SSEs on transmission dynamics, should not be overlooked. Many explosive SSEs have occurred in indoor settings stoking the pandemic and shaping its spread, such as long-term care facilities, prisons, meat-packing plants, fish factories, cruise ships, family gatherings, parties and night clubs. These SSEs demonstrate the urgent need to understand routes of transmission, while posing an opportunity that outbreak can be effectively contained with targeted interventions to eliminate SSEs. Here, we describe the potential types of SSEs, how they influence transmission, and give recommendations for control of SARS-CoV-2.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Evaluating the public health threat posed by a new variant is essential for appropriately adapting response efforts when community transmission is detected. However, this assessment requires that a true comparison can be made between the new variant and its predecessors because factors other than the virus genotype may influence spread and transmission. In this study, we develop a framework that integrates genomic surveillance data to estimate the relative effective reproduction number (Rt) of co-circulating lineages. We use Connecticut, a state in the northeastern United States in which the SARS-CoV-2 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.526 co-circulated in early 2021, as a case study for implementing this framework. We find that the Rt of B.1.1.7 was 6-10% larger than that of B.1.526 in Connecticut in the midst of a COVID-19 vaccination campaign. To assess the generalizability of this framework, we apply it to genomic surveillance data from New York City and observe the same trend. Finally, we use discrete phylogeography to demonstrate that while both variants were introduced into Connecticut at comparable frequencies, clades that resulted from introductions of B.1.1.7 were larger than those resulting from B.1.526 introductions.

However, there are currently no studies in the country that provide a quantitative assessment of the ability of the disease to spread during these outbreaks. This limits our understanding of the epidemiology of the disease especially for planning and implementing quantifiable and cost-effective control measures. To fill this gap, the basic reproduction number, R(0), for bubonic plague was estimated in this study, using data from the 2015 Nyimba district outbreak, in the Eastern province of Zambia. R(0) is the average number of secondary infections arising from a single infectious individual during their infectious period in an entirely susceptible population. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Secondary epidemic data for the most recent 2015 Nyimba district bubonic plague outbreak in Zambia was analyzed. R(0) was estimated as a function of the average epidemic doubling time based on the initial exponential growth rate of the outbreak and the average infectious period for bubonic plague. R(0) was estimated to range between 1.5599 [95% CI: 1.382\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.7378] and 1.9332 [95% CI: 1.6366\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.2297], with average of 1.7465 [95% CI: 1.5093\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.9838]. Further, an SIR deterministic mathematical model was derived for this infection and this estimated R(0) to be between 1.4 to 1.5, which was within the range estimated above. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This estimated R(0) for bubonic plague is an indication that each bubonic plague case can typically give rise to almost two new cases during these outbreaks.

Indirect transmission facilitates spread from multiple sources beyond the infectious host, complicating the epidemiology and control of these diseases. This study carried out a series of transmission experiments to determine the dose-response relationship between environmental contamination and transmission of FMDV in cattle from measurements of viral shedding and rates of environmental contamination and survival. Seven out of ten indirect exposures resulted in successful transmission. The basic reproduction number for environmental transmission of FMDV in this experimental setting was estimated at 1.65, indicating that environmental transmission alone could sustain an outbreak. Importantly, detection of virus in the environment prior to the appearance of clinical signs in infected cattle and successful transmission from these environments highlights there is a risk of environmental transmission even before foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is clinically apparent in cattle. Estimated viral decay rates suggest that FMDV remained viable in this environment for up to 14 days, emphasizing the requirement for stringent biosecurity procedures following outbreaks of FMD and the design of control measures that reflect the biology of a pathogen.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Subsequently, we derive mean field, pair approximation, intertwined continuous Markov chain and probabilistic discrete Markov chain models of a COVID-19-inspired susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) epidemic process with quarantine and isolation strategies, and for each model identify the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , which determines whether an introduced infinitesimal level of infection in an initially susceptible population will shrink or grow. We apply these four continuous state models, together with discrete state Monte Carlo simulations, to analyse how spreading varies with model parameters. Both network properties and the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations vary substantially with dimension or rewiring rate, but predictions of continuous state models change only slightly. A different trend appears for epidemic model parameters: as these vary, the outcomes of Monte Carlo change less than those of continuous state methods. Furthermore, under a wide range of conditions, the four continuous state approximations present similar deviations from the outcome of Monte Carlo simulations. This bias is usually least when using the pair approximation model, varies only slightly with network size, and decreases with dimension or rewiring rate.

This virus emerged in late December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei, China. The grim fact of COVID-19 is, it is highly contagious in nature, therefore, spreads rapidly all over the world and causes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Responding to the severity of COVID-19 research community directs the attention to the analysis of COVID-19, to diminish its antagonistic impact towards society. Numerous studies claim that the subcontinent, i.e., Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan, could remain in the worst affected region by the COVID-19. In order to prevent the spread of COVID-19, it is important to predict the trend of COVID-19 beforehand the planning of effective control strategies. Fundamentally, the idea is to dependably estimate the reproduction number to judge the spread rate of COVID-19 in a particular region. Consequently, this paper uses publicly available epidemiological data of Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan to estimate the reproduction numbers. More specifically, we use various models (for example, susceptible infection recovery (SIR), exponential growth (EG), sequential Bayesian (SB), maximum likelihood (ML) and time dependent (TD)) to estimate the reproduction numbers and observe the model fitness in the corresponding data set. Experimental results show that the reproduction numbers produced by these models are greater than 1.2 (approximately) indicates that COVID-19 is gradually spreading in the subcontinent.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The direct transmission is considered to be a non-monotone incidence function to describe the psychological effect of some severe diseases among the population when the number of infected hosts is large and/or the disease possesses high case fatality rate. The system has a disease-free equilibrium which is locally asymptomatically stable when the basic reproduction number (R0) is less than unity and may have up to four endemic equilibria. Analytical expression representing the epidemic growth rate is obtained for the system. Sensitivity of the two transmission pathways were compared with respect to the epidemic growth rate. We numerically find that the direct transmission coefficient is more sensitive than the indirect transmission coefficient with respect to R0 and the epidemic growth rate. Local stability of endemic equilibria is studied. Further, the global asymptotic stability of the endemic equilibrium is proved using Li and Muldowney geometric approach. The explicit condition for which the system undergoes backward bifurcation is obtained. The basic model also exhibits the hysteresis phenomenon which implies diseases will persist even when R0 < 1 although the system undergoes a forward bifurcation and this phenomenon is rarely observed in disease models. Consequently, our analysis suggests that the diseases with multiple transmission routes exhibit bi-stable dynamics. However, efficient application of temporary control in bi-stable regions will curb the disease to lower endemicity.

The emphasis in this work will be on the study of the propagation of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Various epidemiologically relevant assumptions will be imposed upon the problem, and a coupled system of first-order ordinary differential equations will be obtained. The model adopts the form of a nonlinear susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered system, and we investigate it both analytically and numerically. Analytically, we obtain the equilibrium points in the presence and absence of the coronavirus. We also calculate the reproduction number and provide conditions that guarantee the local and global asymptotic stability of the equilibria. To that end, various tools from analysis will be employed, including Volterra-type Lyapunov functions, LaSalle\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s invariance principle and the Routh\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hurwitz criterion. To simulate computationally the dynamics of propagation of the disease, we propose a nonstandard finite-difference scheme to approximate the solutions of the mathematical model. A thorough analysis of the discrete model is provided in this work, including the consistency and the stability analyses, along with the capability of the discrete model to preserve the equilibria of the continuous system. Among other interesting results, our numerical simulations confirm the stability properties of the equilibrium points.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Additionally, the basic reproduction number (R0) and number of infectors and patients who left Hubei were estimated using the coordinate descent algorithm. The median R0 at the initial stage of the epidemic was 4.97 (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.82-5.17). Before the traffic lockdown was implemented in Hubei, 2000 (95% CI 1982-2030) infectors and patients had left Hubei and traveled throughout the country. The model estimated that if the government had taken prevention and control measures 1 day later, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed patients in the whole country would have increased by 32.1%. If the lockdown of Hubei was imposed 1 day in advance, the cumulative number of laboratory-confirmed patients in other provinces would have decreased by 7.7%. The stochastic model could fit the officially issued data well and simulate the evolution process of the epidemic.

During the first month the number of identified imported cases was 25. The first 291 laboratory-confirmed cases of the COVID -19 outbreak are used to characterize the epidemiological pattern and estimate the epidemiological parameters such as serial interval, basic and effective reproduction numbers and to evaluate the effectiveness of first timely disease spread containment measures. Methods & Materials Epidemiological data were collected through case-based disease COVID -19 surveillance, outbreak investigation and contact tracing data for every confirmed case comprising information on demographics, travel history, date of symptom onset, clinical symptoms, laboratory results, hospitalization, and contacts details. Estimates of the reproduction number and serial interval were performed in R statistical software using R packages developed by the R Epidemics Consortium. Results Public health authorities were able to identify and trace an average of 10 close contacts per for every positive case. The number of transmission events reported per infector ranges from 1 to 16, with 30% having two secondary cases per infector. The median value of every positive case was with 2 secondary infected cases (mean 3.3, standard deviation 3.2). Based on 43 pairs of primary infectors and secondary cases the mean serial interval was estimated 4.8 days (standard deviation 3.9). The basic reproduction number has been estimated at 2.19 (95% CI 1.6 to 2.8), while effective reproduction number showed a decreasing trend by the second week and reaching a plateau around the critical value during the first month. The social distance measures such as were implemented March 12 going to a total lockdown on March 15 with all travels suspended. Conclusion Following the detection of the first COVID -19 case, Albania acted swiftly to implement immediate social distancing and lockdown measures. Such drastic measures had a huge effect on COVID-19 control in the beginning. However, the trend of effective reproduction numbers show a plateau for almost the last two weeks of the month with no signs of further decline.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Media reports on COVID-19\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhich can induce precautionary behaviour such as social distancing, by providing disease-related information to the public\u00e2\u20ac\u201dare thought to be effective in containing the spread. We include the media-reporting data collected from authoritative and popular websites, along with the corresponding IP-visiting data, to study the effects of media reports in curbing the outbreak of COVID-19 in Beijing. To quantify how social distancing affects the spread of COVID-19, we differentiate the fully susceptible from those susceptibles who are media aware and practice social distancing or are quarantined. We propose a discrete compartment model with the fully susceptible, the media-aware susceptible, and the quarantined susceptible as three separate classes. We adopt functions dependent on the media reports and the contacts of media-aware susceptibles to describe the progression rate of susceptibles to media-aware susceptibles. By fitting the targeted model to data on the two Beijing outbreaks, we estimated the reproduction numbers for the two outbreaks as R 0 = 1.6818 and R 0 = 1.3251 , respectively. Cross-correlation analysis on our collected data suggests a strong correlation between the media reporting and epidemic case data. Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis show that even with the intensified interventions in force, reducing either the social distancing uptake rate or the average duration of social distancing for media-aware susceptibles could aggravate the severity of the two outbreaks in Beijing by magnifying the final confirmed cases and lengthening the end time of the pandemic. Our findings demonstrate that enhancing social distancing and media reporting alone, if done in sufficient measures, are enough to alleviate the COVID-19 epidemic.

                "prompt": "Fomite-mediated transmission as a sufficient pathway: a comparative analysis across three viral pathogens\nBACKGROUND: Fomite mediated transmission can be an important pathway causing significant disease transmission in number of settings such as schools, daycare centers, and long-term care facilities. The importance of these pathways relative to other transmission pathways such as direct person-person or airborne will depend on the characteristics of the particular pathogen and the venue in which transmission occurs. Here we analyze fomite mediated transmission through a comparative analysis across multiple pathogens and venues. METHODS: We developed and analyzed a compartmental model that explicitly accounts for fomite transmission by including pathogen transfer between hands and surfaces. We consider two sub-types of fomite-mediated transmission: direct fomite (e.g., shedding onto fomites) and hand-fomite (e.g., shedding onto hands and then contacting fomites). We use this model to examine three pathogens with distinct environmental characteristics (influenza, rhinovirus, and norovirus) in four venue types. To parameterize the model for each pathogen we conducted a thorough literature search. RESULTS: Based on parameter estimates from the literature the reproductive number ([Formula: see text] ) for the fomite route for rhinovirus and norovirus is greater than 1 in nearly all venues considered, suggesting that this route can sustain transmission. For influenza, on the other hand, [Formula: see text] for the fomite route is smaller suggesting many conditions in which the pathway may not sustain transmission. Additionally, the direct fomite route is more relevant than the hand-fomite route for influenza and rhinovirus, compared to norovirus. The relative importance of the hand-fomite vs. direct fomite route for norovirus is strongly dependent on the fraction of pathogens initially shed to hands. Sensitivity analysis stresses the need for accurate measurements of environmental inactivation rates, transfer efficiencies, and pathogen shedding. CONCLUSIONS: Fomite-mediated transmission is an important pathway for the three pathogens examined. The effectiveness of environmental interventions differs significantly both by pathogen and venue. While fomite-based interventions may be able to lower [Formula: see text] for fomites below 1 and interrupt transmission, rhinovirus and norovirus are so infectious ([Formula: see text] ) that single environmental interventions are unlikely to interrupt fomite transmission for these pathogens.

This study aimed to estimate the nine-month trend of time-varying R of COVID-19 epidemic using the serial interval (SI) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Lorestan, west of Iran. Study design: Descriptive study. Methods: This study was conducted based on a cross-sectional method. The SI distribution was extracted from data and log-normal, Weibull, and Gamma models were fitted. The estimation of time-varying R(0), a likelihood-based model was applied, which uses pairs of cases to estimate relative likelihood. Results: In this study, R(t) was estimated for SI 7-day and 14-day time-lapses from 27 February-14 November 2020. To check the robustness of the R(0) estimations, sensitivity analysis was performed using different SI distributions to estimate the reproduction number in 7-day and 14-day time-lapses. The R(0) ranged from 0.56 to 4.97 and 0.76 to 2.47 for 7-day and 14-day time-lapses. The doubling time was estimated to be 75.51 days (95% CI: 70.41, 81.41). Conclusions: Low R(0) of COVID-19 in some periods in Lorestan, west of Iran, could be an indication of preventive interventions, namely quarantine and isolation. To control the spread of the disease, the reproduction number should be reduced by decreasing the transmission and contact rates and shortening the infectious period.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Objectives: We quantified potential effects of future climate change on the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of the tick vector of Lyme disease, Ixodes scapularis, and explored their importance for Lyme disease risk, and for vector-borne diseases in general. Methods: We applied observed temperature data for North America and projected temperatures using regional climate models to drive an I. scapularis population model to hindcast recent, and project future, effects of climate warming on R(0). Modeled R(0) increases were compared with R(0) ranges for pathogens and parasites associated with variations in key ecological and epidemiological factors (obtained by literature review) to assess their epidemiological importance. Results: R(0) for I. scapularis in North America increased during the years 1971\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532010 in spatio-temporal patterns consistent with observations.

Conclusions: Climate warming may have co-driven the emergence of Lyme disease in northeastern North America, and in the future may drive substantial disease spread into new geographic regions and increase tick-borne disease risk where climate is currently suitable. Our findings highlight the potential for climate change to have profound effects on vectors and vector-borne diseases, and the need to refocus efforts to understand these effects.

The median doubling time and R0 were calculated for a rolling period of seven days. Interventions were scored from zero to three with an increasing level of stringency. Multivariate linear regression was performed to find the role of individual interventions on R0 and the median doubling time.

Stringent border control together with aggressive case finding, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine measures were implemented to halt the importation and spread of the virus. METHODS: We performed an epidemiological study using government information covering the first 100 confirmed cases to examine the epidemic curve, incidence, clusters, reproduction number (Rt), incubation period and time to containment. RESULTS: A total of 93 of the 100 cases were HK residents (6 infected in Mainland China, 10 on the Diamond Princess Cruise). Seven were visitors infected in Mainland China before entering HK. The majority (76%) were aged &#8805;45 years, and the incidence increased with age (P < 0.001). Escalation of border control measures correlated with a decrease in the proportion (62.5% to 0%) of cases imported from Mainland China, and a reduction in Rt (1.07 to 0.75). The median incubation period was 4.2 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-4.5; 5th and 95th percentiles: 1.3 and 14.0). Most clusters with identifiable epidemiological links were households involving 2-4 people. Three medium-spreading events were identified: two from New Year gatherings (6-11 people), and another from environmental contamination of a worship hall (12 people). Despite intensified contact tracing, containment was delayed in 78.9% of cases (mean = 5.96 days, range = 0-24 days). An unusual transmission in a multi-storey building via faulty toilet plumbing was suspected with >100 residents evacuated overnight. Our analysis indicated that faulty plumbing was unlikely to be the source of this transmission. CONCLUSION: Timely stringent containment policies minimized the importation and transmission of COVID-19 in HK.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Using the available data, since its first reported case on 16 March 2020, we seek to develop a predicative tool for the cumulative number of reported cases and the number of active cases in Lagos; we also estimate the basic reproduction number of the disease outbreak in the aforementioned State in Nigeria. Using numerical simulations, we show the effect of control measures, specifically the common social distancing, use of face mask and case detection (via contact tracing and subsequent testings) on the dynamics of COVID-19. We also provide forecasts for the cumulative number of reported cases and active cases for different levels of the control measures being implemented. Numerical simulations of the model show that if at least 55% of the population comply with the social distancing regulation with about 55% of the population effectively making use of face masks while in public, the disease will eventually die out in the population and that, if we can step up the case detection rate for symptomatic individuals to about 0.8 per day, with about 55% of the population complying with the social distancing regulations, it will lead to a great decrease in the incidence (and prevalence) of COVID-19.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Hence, the model contains certain biological relations that are thought to be key factors driving this interaction which allow us to obtain precise logical conclusions. Therefore, it improves our perception, that would otherwise not be possible, to comprehend the pathogenesis, to interpret clinical data, to control treatment, and to suggest new relations. This model can be used to study viral dynamics in patients for a wide range of infectious diseases like HIV, HPV, HBV, HCV, and Covid-19. Though, analysis of a new multiscale HCV model incorporating the immune system response is considered in detail, the analysis and results can be applied for all other viruses. The model utilizes a transformed multiscale model in the form of ordinary differential equations (ODE) and incorporates into it the interaction of the immune system. The role of CTLs and the role of antibody responses are investigated. The positivity of the solutions is proven, the basic reproduction number is obtained, and the equilibrium points are specified. The stability at the equilibrium points is analyzed based on the Lyapunov invariance principle. By using appropriate Lyapunov functions, the uninfected equilibrium point is proven to be globally asymptotically stable when the reproduction number is less than one and unstable otherwise. Global stability of the infected equilibrium points is considered, and it has been found that each equilibrium point has a specific domain of stability. Stability regions could be overlapped and a bistable equilibria could be found, which means the coexistence of two stable equilibrium points. Hence, the solution converges to one of them depending on the initial conditions.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Once available, vaccine is gradually produced, evoking the question on how to distribute it best. While official vaccination guidelines largely focus on the question to whom vaccines should be provided first (e.g. to risk groups), here we propose a strategy for their distribution in time and space, which sequentially prioritizes regions with a high local infection growth rate. To demonstrate this strategy, we develop a simple statistical model describing the time-evolution of infection patterns and their response to vaccination, for infectious diseases like Covid-19. For inhomogeneous infection patterns, locally well-mixed populations and basic reproduction numbers $R_0\\sim 1.5-4$ the proposed strategy at least halves the number of deaths in our simulations compared to the standard practice of distributing vaccines proportionally to the population density. For $R_0\\sim 1$ we still find a significant increase of the survival rate. The proposed vaccine distribution strategy can be further tested in detailed modelling works and could excite discussions on the importance of the spatiotemporal distribution of vaccines for official guidelines.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Stochastic extinction of epidemics: how long does would it take for Sars-Cov-2 to die out?\nWorldwide, we are currently in an unprecedented situation with regard to the SARS-Cov-2 epidemic, where countries are using isolation and lock-down measures to control the spread of infection. This is a scenario generally not much anticipated by previous theory, and in particular, there has been little attention paid to the question of extinction as a means to eradicate the virus; the prevailing view appears to be that this is unfeasible without a vaccine. We use a simple well-mixed stochastic SIR model as a basis for our considerations, and calculate a new result, using branching process theory, for the distribution of times to extinction. Surprisingly, the distribution is an extreme value distribution of the Gumbel type, and we show that the key parameter determining its mean and standard deviation is the expected rate of decline Re = {gamma}(1-Re) of infections, where {gamma} is the rate of recovery from infection and Re is the usual effective reproductive number. The result also reveals a critical threshold number of infected I\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c2\u00a0 = 1/(1-Re), below which stochastic forces dominate and need be considered for accurate predictions. As this theory ignores migration between populations, we compare against a realistic spatial epidemic simulator and simple stochastic simulations of sub-divided populations with global migration, to find very comparable results to our simple predictions; in particular, we find global migration has the effect of a simple upwards rescaling of Re with the same Gumbel extinction time distribution we derive from our non-spatial model. Within the UK, using recent estimates of I0{approx}37000 infected and Re= 0.9, this model predicts a mean extinction time of 616{+/-}90 days or approximately ~2 years, but could be as short as 123{+/-}15 days, or roughly 4 months for Re = 0.4. Globally, the theory predicts extinction in less than 200 days, if the reproductive number is restricted to Re < 0.5. Overall, these results highlight the extreme sensitivity of extinction times when Re approaches 1 and the necessity of reducing the effective reproductive number significantly (Re<{approx}0.5) for relatively rapid extinction of an epidemic or pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This number is computed with the R0 package, which better captures past variations, and the EpiEstim package, which provides a more accurate estimate of current values. Rt can be computed in different countries using either the daily number of new cases or of deaths. For France, these numbers can also be computed at the regional and departmental level using also daily numbers of hospital and ICU admissions. Finally, in addition to Rt, we represent the incidence using a one-week sliding window to buffer daily variations.

Predictive studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with emergence. However, emerging pathogens vary widely in virulence, a key determinant of their ultimate risk to public health. Here, we use structured literature searches to review the virulence of each of the 214 known human-infective RNA virus species. We then use a machine learning framework to determine whether viral virulence can be predicted by ecological traits including human-to-human transmissibility, transmission routes, tissue tropisms and host range. Using severity of clinical disease as a measurement of virulence, we identified potential risk factors using predictive classification tree and random forest ensemble models. The random forest model predicted literature-assigned disease severity of test data with 90.3% accuracy, compared to a null accuracy of 74.2%. In addition to viral taxonomy, the ability to cause systemic infection, having renal and/or neural tropism, direct contact or respiratory transmission, and limited (0 < R0 \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a4 1) human-to-human transmissibility were the strongest predictors of severe disease. We present a novel, comparative perspective on the virulence of all currently known human RNA virus species. The risk factors identified may provide novel perspectives in understanding the evolution of virulence and elucidating molecular virulence mechanisms. These risk factors could also improve planning and preparedness in public health strategies as part of a predictive framework for novel human infections. Newly emerging infectious diseases present potentially serious threats to global health. Although studies have begun to identify pathogen traits associated with the emergence of new human diseases, these do not address why emerging infections vary in the severity of disease they cause, often termed \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153virulence\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2. We test whether ecological traits of human viruses can act as predictors of virulence, as suggested by theoretical studies. We conduct the first systematic review of virulence across all currently known human RNA virus species. We adopt a machine learning approach by constructing a random forest, a model that aims to optimally predict an outcome using a specific structure of predictors. Predictions matched literature-assigned ratings for 28 of 31 test set viruses. Our predictive model suggests that higher virulence is associated with infection of multiple organ systems, nervous systems or the renal systems. Higher virulence was also associated with contact-based or airborne transmission, and limited capability to transmit between humans. These risk factors may provide novel starting points for questioning why virulence should evolve and identifying causative mechanisms of virulence. In addition, our work could suggest priority targets for infectious disease surveillance and future public health risk strategies. Comparative analysis using machine learning shows specificity of tissue tropism and transmission biology can act as predictive risk factors for virulence of human RNA viruses.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We aimed to analyze how these effects can bias key epidemiological metrics used to track and monitor SARS-CoV-2 epidemics. Methods: An age-structured mathematical model was constructed to simulate progression of SARS-CoV-2 epidemics in populations. PCR testing to diagnose infection and cross-sectional surveys to measure seroprevalence were also simulated. Analyses were conducted on simulated outcomes assuming a natural epidemic time course and an epidemic in presence of interventions. Results: The prolonged PCR positivity biased the epidemiological measures. There was a lag of 10 days between the true epidemic peak and the actually-observed peak. Prior to epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate was 2-fold higher than that based only on current active infection, and half of those tested positive by PCR were in the prolonged PCR positivity stage after infection clearance. Post epidemic peak, PCR positivity rate poorly predicted true trend in active infection. Meanwhile, the prolonged PCR positivity did not appreciably bias estimation of the basic reproduction number R0. The time delay in development of detectable antibodies biased measured seroprevalence. The actually-observed seroprevalence substantially underestimated true prevalence of ever infection, with the underestimation being most pronounced around epidemic peak. Conclusions: Caution is warranted in interpreting PCR and serological testing data, and any drawn inferences need to factor the effects of the investigated biases for an accurate assessment of epidemic dynamics.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Our aim is to predict the impact of the compulsory containment on COVID-19 spread. Earlier knowledge of the epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 transmission related to Morocco will be of great interest to establish an optimal plan-of-action to control the epidemic. Method: Using a Susceptible-Asymptomatic-Infectious model and the data of reported cumulative confirmed cases in Morocco from March 2nd to April 9, 2020, we determined the basic and control reproduction numbers and we estimated the model parameter values. Furthermore, simulations of different scenarios of containment are performed. Results: Epidemic characteristics are predicted according to different rates of containment. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 2.9949, with CI(2.6729-3.1485). Furthermore, a threshold value of containment rate, below which the epidemic duration is postponed, is determined. Conclusion: Our findings show that the basic reproduction number reflects a high speed of spread of the epidemic. Furthermore, the compulsory containment can be efficient if more than 73% of population are confined. However, even with 90% of containment, the end-time is estimated to happen on July 4th which can be harmful and lead to consequent social-economic damages. Thus, containment need to be accompanied by other measures such as mass testing to reduce the size of asymptomatic population. Indeed, our sensitivity analysis investigation shows that the COVID-19 dynamics depends strongly on the asymptomatic duration as well as the contact and containment rates. Our results can help the Moroccan government to anticipate the spread of COVID-19 and avoid human loses and consequent social-economic damages as well.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: We searched modeling publications through PubMed and associated references from 1990 to 30 September 2009. Inclusion criteria were modeling papers quantifying the effectiveness of combination strategies, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical. RESULTS: Nineteen modeling papers on combination strategies were selected. Four studies examined combination strategies on a global scale, 14 on single countries, and one on a small community. Stochastic individual-based modeling was used in nine studies, stochastic meta-population modeling in five, and deterministic compartmental modeling in another five. As part of combination strategies, vaccination was explored in eight studies, antiviral prophylaxis and/or treatment in 16, area or household quarantine in eight, case isolation in six, social distancing measures in 10 and air travel restriction in six studies. Two studies suggested a high probability of successful influenza epicenter containment with combination strategies under favorable conditions. During a pandemic, combination strategies delayed spread, reduced overall number of cases, and delayed and reduced peak attack rate more than individual strategies. Combination strategies remained effective at high reproductive numbers compared with single strategy. Global cooperative strategies, including redistribution of antiviral drugs, were effective in reducing the global impact and attack rates of pandemic influenza. CONCLUSION: Combination strategies increase the effectiveness of individual strategies. They include pharmaceutical (antiviral agents, antibiotics and vaccines) and non-pharmaceutical interventions (case isolation, quarantine, personal hygiene measures, social distancing and travel restriction).

Presently, due to the unavailability of a definitive vaccine to decrease its acquiring, it is essential to understand its transmissibility in the community by undetected cases to control its transmission. This study aims to study this context using mathematical modelling. Methods: A COVID-19 transmission model was framed that estimated the basic reproduction number (R_0, a measurement of disease risk) using the next-generation method. It explored the contribution of exposed and infected (detected and undetected) individuals, and environmental pathogen to the overall risk of infection spreading, utilizing the publicly reported data of this infection in Maharashtra between March 22, 2020, and May 4, 2020. A sensitivity analysis was performed to study the effect of a rising number of undetected cases to R_0. Results: The estimated basic reproduction number is R_0=4.63, which increases rapidly with the rise in the undetected COVID-19 cases. Although the exposed individuals made the largest contribution to infection transmission (R_1=2.42), the contaminated environment also played a significant role. Conclusions: It is crucial to identify the individuals exposed and infected to COVID-19 disease and isolate them to control its transmission. The awareness of the role of fomites in infection transmission is also important in this regard.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Wuhan is the most serious affected city. Some measures have been taken to control the transmission of COVID-19. From Jan. 23rd, 2020, gradually increasing medical resources (such as health workforce, protective clothing, essential medicines) were sent to Wuhan from other provinces, and the government has established the hospitals to quarantine and treat infected individuals. Under the condition of sufficient medical resources in Wuhan, late-stage of epidemic showed a downward trend. Assessing the effectiveness of medical resources is of great significance for the future response to similar disease. Based on the transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 and epidemic characteristics of Wuhan, by using time-dependent rates for some parameters, we establish a dynamical model to reflect the changes of medical resources on transmission of COVID-19 in Wuhan. Our model is applied to simulate the reported data on cumulative and new confirmed cases in Wuhan from Jan. 23rd to Mar. 6th, 2020. We estimate the basic reproduction number R0 = 2.71, which determines whether the disease will eventually die out or not under the absence of effective control measures. Moreover, we calculate the effective daily reproduction ratio Re(t), which is used to measure the 'daily reproduction number'. We obtain that Re(t) drops less than 1 since Feb. 8th. Our results show that delayed opening the 'Fire God Hill' hospital will greatly increase the magnitude of the outbreak. This shows that the government's timely establishment of hospitals and effective quarantine via quick detection prevent a larger outbreak.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We conducted a prospective multicentre study to assess SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antibody responses in dialysis patients and renal transplant recipients, and patients receiving immunosuppression for autoimmune disease. Methods: Patients were recruited from three UK centres (ethics:20/EM/0180) and compared to healthy controls (ethics:17/EE/0025). SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies to spike protein were measured using a multiplex Luminex assay, after first and second doses of Pfizer BioNTech BNT162b2(Pfizer) or Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1nCoV-19(AZ) vaccine. Results: 692 patients were included (260 dialysis, 209 transplant, 223 autoimmune disease (prior rituximab 128(57%)) and 144 healthy controls. 299(43%) patients received Pfizer vaccine and 379(55%) received AZ. Following two vaccine doses, positive responses occurred in 96% dialysis, 52% transplant, 70% autoimmune patients and 100% of healthy controls. In dialysis patients, higher antibody responses were observed with the Pfizer vaccination. Predictors of poor antibody response were triple immunosuppression (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]0.016;95%CI0.002-0.13;p<0.001) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (aOR0.2;95%CI 0.1-0.42;p<0.001) in transplant patients;rituximab within 12 months in autoimmune patients (aOR0.29;95%CI 0.008\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01530.096;p<0.001) and patients receiving immunosuppression with eGFR 15-29ml/min (aOR0.031;95%CI 0.11\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01530.84;p=0.021). Conclusions: Amongst dialysis, kidney transplant and autoimmune populations SARS-CoV-2 vaccine antibody responses are reduced compared to healthy controls. A reduced response to vaccination was associated with rituximab, MMF, triple immunosuppression CKD stage 4. Vaccine responses increased after the second dose, suggesting low-responder groups should be prioritised for repeated vaccination. Greater antibody responses were observed with the mRNA Pfizer vaccine compared to adenovirus AZ vaccine in dialysis patients suggesting that Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 vaccine should be the preferred vaccine choice in this sub-group.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Tracking progress towards malaria elimination in China: Individual-level estimates of transmission and its spatiotemporal variation using a diffusion network approach\nIn order to monitor progress towards malaria elimination, it is crucial to be able to measure changes in spatio-temporal transmission. However, common metrics of malaria transmission such as parasite prevalence are under powered in elimination contexts. China has achieved major reductions in malaria incidence and is on track to eliminate, having reporting zero locally-acquired malaria cases in 2017 and 2018. Understanding the spatio-temporal pattern underlying this decline, especially the relationship between locally-acquired and imported cases, can inform efforts to maintain elimination and prevent re-emergence. This is particularly pertinent in Yunnan province, where the potential for local transmission is highest. Using a geo-located individual-level dataset of cases recorded in Yunnan province between 2011 and 2016, we introduce a novel Bayesian framework to model a latent diffusion process and estimate the joint likelihood of transmission between cases and the number of cases with unobserved sources of infection. This is used to estimate the case reproduction number, Rc. We use these estimates within spatio-temporal geostatistical models to map how transmission varied over time and space, estimate the timeline to elimination and the risk of resurgence. We estimate the mean Rc between 2011 and 2016 to be 0.171 (95% CI = 0.165, 0.178) for P. vivax cases and 0.089 (95% CI = 0.076, 0.103) for P. falciparum cases. From 2014 onwards, no cases were estimated to have a Rc value above one. An unobserved source of infection was estimated to be moderately likely (p>0.5) for 19/ 611 cases and high (p>0.8) for 2 cases, suggesting very high levels of case ascertainment. Our estimates suggest that, maintaining current intervention efforts, Yunnan is unlikely to experience sustained local transmission up to 2020. However, even with a mean of 0.005 projected up to 2020, locally-acquired cases are possible due to high levels of importation.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Impact of voluntary risk-mitigation behaviour on transmission of the Omicron SARS-CoV-2 variant in England\nAbstract Background The Omicron variant of SARS-CoV-2 infection poses substantial challenges to public health. In England, \"plan B\" mitigation measures were introduced in December 2021 including increased home working and face coverings in shops, but stopped short of restrictions on social contacts. The impact of voluntary risk mitigation behaviours on future SARS-CoV-2 burden is unknown. Methods We developed a rapid online survey of risk mitigation behaviours during the winter 2021 festive period and deployed in two longitudinal cohort studies in the UK (Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and TwinsUK/Covid Symptom Study (CSS) Biobank) in December 2021. Using an individual-based, probabilistic model of COVID-19 transmission between social contacts with SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant parameters and realistic vaccine coverage in England, we describe the potential impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron wave in England in terms of the effective reproduction number and cumulative infections, hospital admissions and deaths. Using survey results, we estimated in real-time the impact of voluntary risk mitigation behaviours on the Omicron wave in England, if implemented for the entire epidemic wave. Results Over 95% of survey respondents (N_ALSPAC=2,686 and N_Twins=6,155) reported some risk mitigation behaviours, with being fully vaccinated and using home testing kits the most frequently reported behaviours. Less than half of those respondents reported that their behaviour was due to \"plan B\". We estimate that without risk mitigation behaviours, the Omicron variant is consistent with an effective reproduction number between 2.5 and 3.5. Due to the reduced vaccine effectiveness against infection with the Omicron variant, our modelled estimates suggest that between 55% and 60% of the English population could be infected during the current wave, translating into between 15,000 and 46,000 cumulative deaths, depending on assumptions about vaccine effectiveness. We estimate that voluntary risk reduction measures could reduce the effective reproduction number to between 1.8 and 2.2 and reduce the cumulative number of deaths by up to 24%. Conclusions We conclude that voluntary measures substantially reduce the projected impact of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant, but that voluntary measures alone would be unlikely to completely control transmission.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

A common approach to tackling the challenge is to use the number of infections exported from the originating city to infer the true number. This approach can only provide a static estimate of the epidemiological parameters before city lockdown because there are almost no exported cases thereafter. Methods: We propose a Bayesian estimation method that dynamically estimates the epidemiological parameters by recovering true numbers of infections from day-to-day official numbers. To illustrate the use of this method, we provide a comprehensive retrospection on how the COVID-19 had progressed in Wuhan from January 19 to March 5, 2020. Particularly, we estimate that the outbreak sizes by January 23 and March 5 were 11,239 [95% CI 4,794\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015322,372] and 124,506 [95% CI 69,526\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153265,113], respectively. Results: The effective reproduction number attained its maximum on January 24 (3.42 [95% CI 3.34\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.50]) and became less than 1 from February 7 (0.76 [95% CI 0.65\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01530.92]). We also estimate the effects of two major government interventions on the spread of COVID-19 in Wuhan.

This study aims to investigate the effects of COVID-19 infection risk and oscillations on depression among community-dwelling older people in Hong Kong.A rolling cross-sectional telephone survey method was used. Screening for depression risk was conducted among 8,163 older people (age \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a5 60) using the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) from February to August 2020.

Recent studies suggest that the population prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, a proxy for the number of asymptomatic cases, could be an order of magnitude larger than expected from the number of reported symptomatic cases. Knowing the precise prevalence and contagiousness of asymptomatic transmission is critical to estimate the overall dimension and pandemic potential of COVID-19. However, at this stage, the effect of the asymptomatic population, its size, and its outbreak dynamics remain largely unknown. Here we use reported symptomatic case data in conjunction with antibody seroprevalence studies, a mathematical epidemiology model, and a Bayesian framework to infer the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19. Our model computes, in real time, the time-varying contact rate of the outbreak, and projects the temporal evolution and credible intervals of the effective reproduction number and the symptomatic, asymptomatic, and recovered populations. Our study quantifies the sensitivity of the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 to three parameters: the effective reproduction number, the ratio between the symptomatic and asymptomatic populations, and the infectious periods of both groups. For nine distinct locations, our model estimates the fraction of the population that has been infected and recovered by Jun 15, 2020 to 24.15% (95% CI: 20.48%-28.14%) for Heinsberg (NRW, Germany), 2.40% (95% CI: 2.09%-2.76%) for Ada County (ID, USA), 46.19% (95% CI: 45.81%-46.60%) for New York City (NY, USA), 11.26% (95% CI: 7.21%-16.03%) for Santa Clara County (CA, USA), 3.09% (95% CI: 2.27%-4.03%) for Denmark, 12.35% (95% CI: 10.03%-15.18%) for Geneva Canton (Switzerland), 5.24% (95% CI: 4.84%-5.70%) for the Netherlands, 1.53% (95% CI: 0.76%-2.62%) for Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), and 5.32% (95% CI: 4.77%-5.93%) for Belgium.

We then compare the simulation results of our three epidemiological models of interest against the daily reported COVID-19 case counts across the time period from 23rd January to 6th April 2020. Finally, we compare and evaluate on the performance and accuracy of the aforementioned models' simulations. Methods: Three epidemiological models are used to forecast the true growth of COVID-19 case counts by accounting for asymptomatic infections in Singapore. They are the exponential model, SEIR model with hospitalization dynamics (SEIHRD), and the SEIHRD model with inclusion of asymptomatic cases (SEAIHRD). Results: Simulation results of all three models reflect underestimation of COVID-19 cases in Singapore during the early stages of the pandemic. At a 40% asymptomatic proportion, we report basic reproduction number R0 = 3.28 and 3.74 under the SEIHRD and SEAIHRD models respectively. At a 60% asymptomatic proportion, we report R0 = 3.48 and 3.96 under the SEIHRD and SEAIHRD models respectively.

And most countries with significant outbreaks had introduced social distancing or \"lockdown\" measures to reduce viral transmission. So the key question now is when, how, and to what extent, these measures can be lifted. By fitting regression models to publically available data on daily numbers of newly-confirmed cases and mortality, trajectories, doubling times and reproduction number (R0) were estimated both before and under the control measures. These data ran up to 29th April 2020, and covered 73 countries that had provided sufficient data for modelling. The estimates of R0, before lockdown, based on these data were broadly consistent with those previously published at between 2.0 and 3.7 in the countries with the largest number of cases available for analysis (USA, Italy, Spain, France and UK). There was little evidence to suggest that the restrictions had reduced R far below 1 in many places, with France having the most rapid reductions - R0 0.77 (95%CI 0.68-0.87), based on cases and 0.78 (95%CI 0.68-0.88) based on mortality. Intermittent lockdown has been proposed as a means of controlling the outbreak while allowing periods of increase freedom and economic activity. These data suggest that few countries could have even one week per month unrestricted without seeing resurgence of the epidemic. Similarly, restoring 20% of the activity that has been prevented by the lockdowns looks difficult to reconcile with preventing the resurgence of the disease in most countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

More than 1 million students were organized in bubble groups and monitored and analyzed by the Health and the Educational departments. METHODS: We had access to 2 data sources, and both were employed for the analysis, one is the Catalan school surveillance system and the other of the educational department. As soon as a positive index case is detected by the health system, isolation is required for all members of the bubble group, in addition to a mandatory proactive systematic screening of each individual. All infected cases are reported. It permits the calculation of the average reproductive number (R*), corresponding to the average number of infected individuals per index case. RESULTS: We found that propagation inside of the bubble group was small. Among 75% index cases, there was no transmission to other members in the classroom, with an average R* across all ages inside the bubble of R* = 0.4. We found a significant age trend in the secondary attack rates, with the R* going from 0.2 in preschool to 0.6 in high school youth.

In particular, the data from Nepal, a developing country having an open border provision with highly COVID-19 affected country India, has shown a biphasic pattern of epidemic, a controlled phase (until July 21, 2020) followed by an outgrown phase (after July 21, 2020). To uncover the effective strategies implemented during the controlled phase, we develop a mathematical model that is able to describe the data from both phases of COVID-19 dynamics in Nepal. Using our best parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval, we found that during the controlled phase most of the recorded cases were imported from outside the country with a small number generated from the local transmission, consistent with the data. Our model predicts that these successful strategies were able to maintain the reproduction number at around 0.21 during the controlled phase, preventing 442,640 cases of COVID-19 and saving more than 1,200 lives in Nepal. However, during the outgrown phase, when the strategies such as border screening and quarantine, lockdown, and detection and isolation, were altered, the reproduction number raised to 1.8, resulting in exponentially growing cases of COVID-19. We further used our model to predict the long-term dynamics of COVID-19 in Nepal and found that without any interventions the current trend may result in about 18.76 million cases (10.70 million detected and 8.06 million undetected) and 89 thousand deaths in Nepal by the end of 2021.

Currently, however, there is much controversy over whether respiratory aerosol microdroplets play an important role as a route of transmission. By measuring and modeling the dynamics of exhaled respiratory droplets, we can assess the relative contribution of aerosols to the spreading of SARS-CoV-2. We measure size distribution, total numbers, and volumes of respiratory droplets, including aerosols, by speaking and coughing from healthy subjects. Dynamic modeling of exhaled respiratory droplets allows us to account for aerosol persistence times in confined public spaces. The probability of infection by inhalation of aerosols when breathing in the same space can then be estimated using current estimates of viral load and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. The current known reproduction numbers show a lower infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 compared to, for instance, measles, which is known to be efficiently transmitted through the air. In line with this, our study of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 suggests that aerosol transmission is a possible but perhaps not a very efficient route, in particular from non-symptomatic or mildly symptomatic individuals that exhibit low viral loads.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

First unconstrained methods are revisited and they are shown to correspond to the application of a linear filter followed by a nonlinear estimate of the effective reproduction number after a change-of-coordinates. Unconstrained methods often fail to keep the estimated variables within their physical range and can lead to unreliable estimates that require aggressively smoothing the raw data. In order to overcome these shortcomings a constrained estimation method is proposed that keeps the model variables within pre-specified boundaries and can also promote smoothness of the estimates. Constrained estimation can be directly applied to raw data without the need of pre-smoothing and the associated loss of information and additional lag. It can also be easily extended to handle additional information, such as the number of infected individuals. The resulting problem is cast as a convex quadratic optimization problem with linear and convex quadratic constraints. It is also shown that both unconstrained and constrained methods when applied to death data are independent of the fatality rate.

Methods We collected publicly available data and compared them using standardisation techniques. We then explored the association between exposures and outcomes using random forest regression and linear regression. We adjusted for potential confounders and plausible effect modifications. Results While mean time-varying reproduction number (mean) was highest in the WHO Europe and Americas regions, median age of death was lower in the Africa region, with broadly similar case-fatality ratio. Population age was strongly associated with mean (\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2= 0.01, 95%CI, 0.005, 0.011) and the median age of cases (\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2= -0.40, 95%CI, -0.53, -0.26) and deaths (\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2= 0.40, 95%CI, 0.17, 0.62).

Although summaries of data are usually provided by the Ministry of Health, detailed epidemiological profile of cases are limited.

Symptomatic subjects had higher viral loads (1479.7 copies/\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b5l; IQR = 40.6-178919) than asymptomatic subjects (49.9; IQR = 5.5-3641.6). There was significant association between gender or age and infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p<0.05). Among all the suspected clinical presentations, anosmia was the strongest predictor of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Adj. OR (95%CI): 24.39 (20.18, 29.49). We observed an average reproductive number of 1.36 with a minimum of 1.28 and maximum of 1.43. The virus trajectory shows a gradual reduction of the virus reproductive number. CONCLUSION: This study has described the epidemiological profile of COVID-19 cases in northern, middle and part of the southern belt of Ghana, with males and younger individuals at greater risk of contracting the disease. Health professionals should be conscious of individuals presenting with anosmia since this was seen as the strongest predictor of virus infection.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Employment of these units in the United States and Western Europe resulted in a significant decrease in mortality compared to traditional management in field settings. Moreover, this employment appeared to significantly lessen the risk of nosocomial transmission of disease; no secondary cases occurred among healthcare workers in these units. While many now accept the wisdom of utilizing HLCC units and principles in the management of EVD (and, presumably, of other transmissible and highly hazardous viral hemorrhagic fevers, such as those caused by Marburg and Lassa viruses), no consensus exists regarding additional diseases that might warrant HLCC. We propose here a construct designed to make such determinations for existing and newly discovered diseases. The construct examines infectivity (as measured by the infectious dose needed to infect 50% of a given population (ID(50))), communicability (as measured by the reproductive number (R(0))), and hazard (as measured by morbidity and mortality). Diseases fulfilling all three criteria (i.e., those that are highly infectious, communicable, and highly hazardous) are considered candidates for HLCC management if they also meet a fourth criterion, namely that they lack effective and available licensed countermeasures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the effectiveness of lockdown on SARS-CoV-2 epidemic progression in nine different countries (New Zealand, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, the UK, Sweden, and the USA). DESIGN: We conducted a cross-country comparative evaluation using a susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-based model completed with pharmacokinetic approaches. MAIN MEASURES: The rate of new daily SARS-CoV-2 cases in the nine countries was calculated from the World Health Organization\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s published data. Using a SIR-based model, we determined the infection (\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2) and recovery (\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3) rate constants; their corresponding half-lives (t(1/2\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2) and t(1/2\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3)); the basic reproduction numbers (R(0) as \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2/\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3); the rates of susceptible S(t), infected I(t), and recovered R(t) compartments; and the effectiveness of lockdown. Since this approach requires the epidemic termination to build the (I) compartment, we determined S(t) at an early epidemic stage using simple linear regressions. KEY RESULTS: In New Zealand, France, Spain, Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, and the UK, early-onset stay-at-home orders and restrictions followed by gradual deconfinement allowed rapid reduction in SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (t(1/2\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a4 14 days) with R(0) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a4 1.5 and rapid recovery (t(1/2\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a4 18 days). By contrast, in Sweden (no lockdown) and the USA (heterogeneous state-dependent lockdown followed by abrupt deconfinement scenarios), a prolonged plateau of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals (terminal t(1/2\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2) of 23 and 40 days, respectively) with elevated R(0) (4.9 and 4.4, respectively) and non-ending recovery (terminal t(1/2\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3) of 112 and 179 days, respectively) was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early-onset lockdown with gradual deconfinement allowed shortening the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and reducing contaminations. Lockdown should be considered as an effective public health intervention to halt epidemic progression.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

It is required to investigate if a new, more contagious strain will be necessarily dominant in the population and resulting in more disease severity. Methods: The impact of the asymptomatic transmission and the emergence time of a more transmissible variant of a multi-strain viral disease on the disease prevalence, disease severity, and the dominant variant in an epidemic was investigated by a proposed 2-strain epidemic model, called 2-SEICARD model, that is an extension of the SEIRD model. Results: The simulation results showed that considering only R0, is insufficient to predict the outcome of a new, more contagious strain in the population. A more transmissible strain with a high fraction of asymptomatic cases can substantially reduce the mortality rate. If the emergence time of the new strain is closer to the start of the epidemic, the new, more contagious variant has more chance to win the viral competition and be the dominant strain; otherwise, despite being more contagious, it cannot dominate previous strains. Conclusions: Three factors of R0, the fraction of asymptomatic transmission, and the emergence time of the new strain are required to correctly determine the prevalence, disease severity, and the winner of the viral competition.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We sought to describe the rapid expansion of the Delta lineage in Ontario, Canada (population 15 million) using mutation profile information and confirmatory whole genome sequencing. Methods: All laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 cases reported to Public Health Ontario between April 1st and June 12th 2021, with cycle threshold values <=35, were eligible for screening for the N501Y and the E484K mutations. We classified cases via mutation screening as: (1) N501Y-/E484K- (wild-type/Delta), (2) Alpha (N501Y+/E484K-), (3) Beta/Gamma (N501Y+/E484K+), or (4) N501Y-/E484K+ (predominantly B.1.525, and B.1.1.318). Results: The N501Y-/E484K- mutation profile went from having a 29% transmission deficit relative to Alpha (relative Re = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.64, 0.77) on April 1st to having a 50% transmission advantage on June 12th (relative Re = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.31, 1.71). Whole genome sequencing of N501Y-/E484K- cases (N=583) confirmed that the pattern of increasing relative reproduction number coincided with the replacement of wild-type with Delta variant (from 2.2% in early April, to 83% in late May). Discussion: Delta is rapidly overtaking other SARS-CoV-2 variants in Ontario, and has a substantial transmission advantage. An inflection in the proportion of cases missing the N501Y mutation from rapidly decreasing to rapidly increasing, may be an early warning signal for Delta lineage expansion.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Due to its simple analytic form, it enables a clear interpretation for all values.

Outside of China, Italy is one of the most suffering countries with the COVID19 epidemic. It is important to predict the epidemics trend of COVID19 epidemic in Italy to help develop public health strategies. Methods: We used time series data of COVID 19 from Jan 22,2020 to Mar 16,2020. An infectious disease dynamic extended susceptible infected removed (eSIR) model, which covers the effects of different intervention measures in dissimilar periods, was applied to estimate the epidemic trend in Italy. The basic reproductive number was estimated using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and presented using the resulting posterior mean and 95% credible interval (CI). Hunan, with similar total number of populations in Italy, was used as a comparative item. Results: In the eSIR model, we estimated that the basic reproductive number for COVID 19 was respectively 4.10 (95% CI: 2.15 to 6.77) in Italy and 3.15(95% CI: 1.71 to 5.21) in Hunan. There would be totally 30 086 infected cases (95%CI:7920-81 869) under the current country blockade and the endpoint would be Apr 25 (95%CI: Mar 30 to Aug 07) in Italy. If the country blockade is imposed 5 day later, the total number of infected cases would expand the infection scale 1.50 times.

Substantial, non-discriminatory limitations have been imposed on air travel to inhibit this spread. As the disease prevalence and incidence will decrease, more specific control measures will be sought so that commercial air travel can continue to operate yet not impose a high threat of COVID-19 resurgence. Methods: We use modelled global air travel data and population density estimates to analyse the risk posed by 1364 airports to initiate a COVID-19 outbreak. We calculate the risk using a probabilistic approach that considers the volume of air travelers between airports and the R0 of each location, scaled by population density. This exercise is performed globally as well as specifically for two potentially vulnerable locations: Africa and India. Results: We show that globally, many of the airports posing the highest risk are in China and India. An outbreak of COVID-19 in Africa is most likely to originate in a passenger travelling from Europe. On the other hand, the highest risk to India is from domestic travellers. Our results are robust to changes in the underlying epidemiological assumptions. Conclusions: Variation in flight volumes and destinations creates a non-uniform distribution of the risk different airports pose to resurgence of a COVID-19 outbreak. We suggest the method presented here as a tool for the estimation of this risk. Our method can be used to inform efficient allocation of resources, such as tests identifying infected passengers, so that they could be differentially deployed in various locations.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods: By means of Weibull, Gamma and Lognormal distributions methods, we estimated the probability distribution of the incubation period and generation interval data obtained from the reported COVID-19 cases. Moreover, the AIC criterion was used to determine the optimal distribution. Considering the epidemic is ongoing, the exponential growth model was used to fit the incidence data of COVID-19 from 10 to 31 January, 2020, and exponential growth method, maximum likelihood method and SEIR model were used to estimate the basic reproduction number. Results: Early COVID-19 cases kept an increase in exponential growth manner before 26 January, 2020, then the increase trend became slower. The average incubation period was 5.01 (95%CI: 4.31-5.69) days; the average generation interval was 6.03 (95%CI: 5.20-6.91) days. The basic reproduction number was estimated to be 3.74 (95%CI: 3.63-3.87), 3.16 (95%CI: 2.90-3.43), and 3.91 (95%CI: 3.71-4.11) by three methods, respectively. Conclusions: The Gamma distribution fits both the generation interval and incubation period best, and the mean value of generation interval is 1.02 day longer than that of incubation period. The relatively high basic reproduction number indicates that the epidemic is still serious; Based on our analysis, the turning point of the epidemic would be seen on 26 January, the growth rate would be lower afterwards.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

These models rely on accurate estimates of key transmission parameters such as the force of infection (FoI), which is the per-capita risk of a susceptible person being infected. The FoI captures the fundamental dynamics of transmission and is crucial for gauging control efforts, such as identifying vaccination targets. Dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne, multiserotype pathogen that currently infects \u00e2\u02c6\u00bc390 million people a year. Existing estimates of the DENV FoI are inaccurate because they rely on the unrealistic assumption that risk is constant over time. Dengue models are thus unreliable for designing vaccine deployment strategies. Here, we present to our knowledge the first time-varying (daily), serotype-specific estimates of DENV FoIs using a spline-based fitting procedure designed to examine a 12-y, longitudinal DENV serological dataset from Iquitos, Peru (11,703 individuals, 38,416 samples, and 22,301 serotype-specific DENV infections from 1999 to 2010). The yearly DENV FoI varied markedly across time and serotypes (0-0.33), as did daily basic reproductive numbers (0.49-4.72). During specific time periods, the FoI fluctuations correlated across serotypes, indicating that different DENV serotypes shared common transmission drivers. The marked variation in transmission intensity that we detected indicates that intervention targets based on one-time estimates of the FoI could underestimate the level of effort needed to prevent disease. Our description of dengue virus transmission dynamics is unprecedented in detail, providing a basis for understanding the persistence of this rapidly emerging pathogen and improving disease prevention programs.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Soon, it has spread out across the world and become an ongoing pandemic. In Bangladesh, the first case of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) was detected on March 8, 2020. Since then, not many significant studies have been conducted to understand the transmission dynamics of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. In this study, we estimated the basic reproduction number R 0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh. Methods: The data of daily confirmed cases of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh and the reported values of generation time of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) for Singapore and Tianjin, China, were collected. We calculated the basic reproduction number R0 by applying the exponential growth (EG) method. Epidemic data of the first 76 days and different values of generation time were used for the calculation. Results: The basic reproduction number R0 of novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in Bangladesh is estimated to be 2.66 [95% CI: 2.58-2.75], optimized R0 is 2.78 [95% CI: 2.69-2.88] using generation time 5.20 with a standard deviation of 1.72 for Singapore.

In this work, a metapopulation model, i.e., networks of populations connected by migratory flows, which overcomes the assumption of homogeneous mixing between different regions was constructed. The TB model was combined to a simple demographic structure for the population living in a multi-patch environment (cities, towns, regions or countries).

Constant recruitment rate, slow and fast progression to the disease, effective chemoprophylaxis, diagnostic and treatment are taken into account to make the model including the reality of people in the sub-Saharan African countries.

Our main aim is to show if the rise-in-cases proceeds in a gradual and staggered manner instead of soaring quickly then we can suppress the burden of the health system. In this new case study, we are attempting to show how to control the outbreak of the infectious disease COVID-19 via mathematical modeling. We have examined that the method of flattening the curve of the coronavirus, which increases the recovery rate of the infected individuals and also helps to decrease the number of deaths. In this pandemic situation, the countries like Russia, India, the United States of America (USA), South Africa, and the United Kingdom (UK) are leading in front where the virus is spreading in an unprecedented way. From our point of view, we establish that if these countries are following the method of flattening the curve like China and South Korea then these countries can also overcome this pandemic situation. Method We propose a Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered (SIR) mathematical model of infectious disease with onset data of COVID-19 in Wuhan and international cases, which has been propagated in Wuhan City to calculate the transmission rate of the infectious virus COVID-19 until now. To understand the whole dynamics of the transmission rate of coronavirus, we portray time series diagrams such as growth rate diagram, flattening the pandemic curve diagram, infected and recovered rate diagram, prediction of the transmission of the disease from the available dataset in Wuhan, and internationally exported cases from Wuhan. Results We have observed that the basic reproduction number in Wuhan declined from 2.2 (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 1.15-4.77) to 1.05 (0.41-2.39) and the mean incubation period was 5.2?days (95% [CI], 4.1-7.0). Interestingly the mean value lies between 2 and 2.5 for COVID-19. The doubling time of COVID-19 was registered 7.4?days (95% CI, 5.3-19) in the early stages and now the value decreases to ?4.9?days. Similarly, we have observed the doubling time of the epidemic in South Korea decreased to ?9.6?days. Currently, the doubling time of the epidemic in Russia, India, and the USA are 19.4?days, 16.4?days, and 41?days, respectively. We have investigated the growth rate of COVID-19 and plotted the curve flattening diagram against time. Conclusion Via flattening the curve method, China and South Korea control the transmission of the fatal disease COVID-19 in the human population. Our results show that these two countries initially sustained pandemics in a large portion of the human population in the form of virus outbreaks that basically prevented the virus from spreading further and created ways to prevent community transmission. The majority portion of the people are perfectly fine, who are quarantined strictly and never get sick, but the portion of people who have developed symptoms is quickly isolated further.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This condition has three advantages: (i) it is easily computable; (ii) it is directly related to the model parameters; (iii) it can be used to enforce a scalability condition that prohibits the amplification of disturbances within the network system.

Despite this frightening picture, denialism and noncompliance with public health measures are common in the historical record, for example during the 1918 Influenza pandemic or the 2015 Ebola epidemic. The unique characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 - its high reproductive number (R0), time-limited natural immunity and considerable potential for asymptomatic spread - exacerbate the public health repercussions of noncompliance with biomedical and nonpharmaceutical interventions designed to limit disease transmission. In this work, we used game theory to explore when noncompliance confers a perceived benefit to individuals, demonstrating that noncompliance is a Nash equilibrium under a broad set of conditions. We then used epidemiological modeling to explore the impact of noncompliance on short-term disease control, demonstrating that the presence of a noncompliant subpopulation prevents suppression of disease spread. Our modeling shows that the existence of a noncompliant population can also prevent any return to normalcy over the long run. For interventions that are highly effective at preventing disease spread, however, the consequences of noncompliance are borne disproportionately by noncompliant individuals. In sum, our work demonstrates the limits of free-market approaches to compliance with disease control measures during a pandemic. The act of noncompliance with disease intervention measures creates a negative externality, rendering COVID-19 disease control ineffective in the short term and making complete suppression impossible in the long term. Our work underscores the importance of developing effective strategies for prophylaxis through public health measures aimed at complete suppression and the need to focus on compliance at a population level.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

India enacted such measures early on for effective mitigation and suppression to reduce community transmission, including an onerous national lockdown. The impact of the health system governance is quite apparent among all stakeholders including the public in such emergency contexts. METHODS: We compiled the daily data on the number of COVID-19 cases, recoveries and deaths from January 30th until June 16th, 2020. Different stages were categorized from post PHEIC declaration (pre-lockdown) phase to lockdown phases and unlocking phase as implemented. The several measures adopted by the national government were structured in four broad categories as Governance and socioeconomic, travel restrictions, lockdown and public health measures. These measures were compared during each phase. RESULTS: It was revealed that while the cases are rising the phased restrictions has helped in delaying the peak and remarkably interrupted the rate of transmission. The national average doubling rate was 3 days at the beginning which improved to 22 days. The basic reproduction number remained close to 1 during the last week of lockdown. However, the initial interruption of needed aid and technical support had negative social and economic impacts on the affected population. CONCLUSIONS: As the situation abates following the measures adopted by the government, an articulate strategy of unlocking through increased testing and prompt isolation needs to be developed for more effective reduction and protecting the livelihoods allowing to further relax the lockdown measures. KEY MESSAGES: There is need for the local government to consider a strategic easing of the lockdown for protecting the rights of the most affected population. As the transmission rates are low, the easing of lockdown can be benefited from improved testing and prompt isolation.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The parameters are therefore fraught with uncertainty. To tackle this problem, we developed a Bayesian Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovery (SEIR) model with ordinary differential equation (ODE) to estimate three parameters, including transmission coefficients, the latent period, and the recovery rate given the uncertainty implicated the outbreak of COVID-19 on cruise ship with modest population size. Based on the estimated results on these three parameters before the introduction of partial containment measures, the natural epidemic curve after intervention was predicted and compared with the observed curve in order to assess the efficacy of containment measures. With the application of the Bayesian model to the empirical data on COVID-19 outbreak on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship, the R0 was estimated as high as 5.71(95% credible interval: 4.08-7.55) because of its aerosols and fomite transmission mode. The simulated trajectory shows the entire epidemic period without containment measurements was approximately 47 days and reached the peak one month later after the index case. The partial containment measure reduced 34% (95% credible interval: 31-36%) infected passengers. Such a discovery provides an insight into timely evacuation and early isolation and quarantine with decontamination for containing other cruise ships and warship outbreaks.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

A lockdown from 24 March was partially relaxed on 10 May. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R(0) and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods: Office for National Statistics data on deaths in England and Wales is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R(0) and forecasts for cases and deaths. Results: The UK initial log growth rate is r = 0.254 with s.e. 0.004. R(0) = 6.94 with 95% CI (6.52, 7.39). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced throughout to 5% of their previous values, peaks of around 90,000 severely and 25,000 critically ill patients, and 44,000 cumulative deaths are expected by 16 June. With transmission rising from 5% in mid-April to reach 30%, 50,000 deaths and 475,000 active cases are expected in mid-June. Had such a lockdown begun on 17 March, around 30,000 (28,000, 32,000) fewer cumulative deaths would be expected by 9 June. Discussion: The R(0) estimate is compatible with some international estimates but over twice the value quoted by the UK government. An earlier lockdown could have saved many thousands of lives.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Recent technological advancements have made infrared (IR) thermometers the choice for contactless screening of multiple individuals. Yet, even so, the measurement accuracy of such thermometers is affected by many factors including the distance from the volunteers' forehead, impurities (such as sweat), and the location measured on the volunteers' forehead. To overcome these factors, we describe the assembly of an Arduino-based digital IR thermometer with distance correction using the MLX90614 IR thermometer and HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors. Coupled with some analysis of these factors, we also found ways to programme compensation methods for the final assembled digital IR thermometer to provide more accurate readings and measurements.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The government acted swiftly to contain transmission, with extensive public health measures. At the end of 30 days, Sri Lanka had 197 cases, 54 recovered and 7 deaths; a staged relaxing of the lockdown is now underway. This paper proposes a theoretical basis for estimating the limits within which transmission should be constrained in order to ensure that the case load remains within the capacity of Sri Lanka\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s health system. METHODS: We used the Susceptible, Infected, Recovered (SIR) model to explore the number of new infections and estimate ICU bed requirement at different levels of R(0) values after lifting lockdown restrictions. We developed a web-based application that enables visualization of cases and ICU bed requirements with time, with adjustable parameters that include: population at risk; number of identified and recovered cases; percentage identified; infectious period; R(0) or doubling time; percentage critically ill; available ICU beds; duration of ICU stay; and uncertainty of projection. RESULTS: The three-day moving average of the caseload suggested two waves of transmission from Day 0 to 17 (R0 = 3.32, 95% CI 1.85\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01535.41) and from Day 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015330 (R = 1.25, 95%CI: 0.93\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.63). We estimate that if there are 156 active cases with 91 recovered at the time of lifting lockdown restrictions, and R increases to 1.5 (doubling time 19 days), under the standard parameters for Sri Lanka, the ICU bed capacity of 300 is likely to be saturated by about 100 days, signaled by 18 new infections (95% CI 15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015322) on Day 14 after lifting lockdown restrictions. CONCLUSION: Our model suggests that to ensure that the case load remains within the available capacity of the health system after lifting lockdown restrictions, transmission should not exceed R = 1.5. This model and the web-based application may be useful in other low and middle income countries which have similar constraints on health resources.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In the absence of highly effective drugs, vaccines, and abundant medical resources, many measures are used to manage the infection rate and avoid exhausting limited hospital resources. Wearing masks is among the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that could be effectively implemented at a minimum cost and without dramatically disrupting social practices. The mask-wearing guidelines vary significantly across countries. Regardless of the debates in the medical community and the global mask production shortage, more countries and regions are moving forward with recommendations or mandates to wear masks in public. Our study combines mathematical modeling and existing scientific evidence to evaluate the potential impact of the utilization of normal medical masks in public to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. We consider three key factors that contribute to the effectiveness of wearing a quality mask in reducing the transmission risk, including the mask aerosol reduction rate, mask population coverage, and mask availability. We first simulate the impact of these three factors on the virus reproduction number and infection attack rate in a general population. Using the intervened viral transmission route by wearing a mask, we further model the impact of mask-wearing on the epidemic curve with increasing mask awareness and availability. Our study indicates that wearing a face mask can be effectively combined with social distancing to flatten the epidemic curve. Wearing a mask presents a rational way to implement as an NPI to combat COVID-19. We recognize our study provides a projection based only on currently available data and estimates potential probabilities.

Results show that the March 2020 lockdown had an impact on disease transmission, bringing the effective reproduction number (R(t)) below 1. We estimate that there was an increase in the transmission after the initial lift of the measures on 6 May 2020 that resulted in a second wave that was curbed by the October and November measures. December 2020 saw an increase in the transmission reaching an R(t) = 1.45 in early January 2021.

A crucial role in epidemics is played by the number of undetected infective individuals who continue to circulate and spread the disease. Epidemiological investigations and mathematical models have revealed that the rapid diffusion of Covid-19 can mostly be attributed to the large percentage of undocumented infective individuals who escape testing. Methods. The dynamics of an infection can be described by the SIR model, which divides the population into susceptible (S), infective (I) and removed (R) subjects. In particular, we exploited the Kermack and McKendrick epidemic model which can be applied when the population is much larger than the fraction of infected subjects. Results. We proved that the fraction of undocumented infectives, in comparison to the total number of infected subjects, is given by 1-1/R0 , where R0 is the basic reproduction number. Its mean value R0=2.10 (2.09-2.11) in three Italian regions for the Covid-19 epidemic yielded a percentage of undetected infectives of 52.4% (52.2% - 52.6%) compared to the total number of infectives. Conclusions. Our results, straightforwardly obtained from the SIR model, highlight the role played by undetected carriers in the transmission and spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such evidence strongly recommends careful monitoring of the infective population and ongoing adjustment of preventive measures for disease control until a vaccine becomes available.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Wenzhou is located approximately 900 km from Wuhan, which was experiencing an outbreak that was severe at the time but is considered modest as the epidemic became a pandemic. We described the epidemiological characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 outside of the epicenter to help understand the transmission pattern in a mid-sized Chinese city. METHODS: To investigate the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19, we described case series of 473 patients with confirmed COVID-19 in Wenzhou, China from January 27 to March 16, 2020. We described the public health interventions of COVID-19 and evaluated the effect of interventions by the effective reproduction number (R(t)). RESULTS: The median age of all patients was 47.6 years, 48.4% of whom were female. 33.8% of the patients had a history of residence in Wuhan. Fever (71.7%) and cough (43.1%) were the most common symptoms. In addition, three kinds of unconventional cases were observed, namely 4.9% asymptomatic patients, 7.6% confirmed patients who had no link to Wuhan city but contact with individuals from Wuhan without any symptoms at the time of contact, and 12.9% confirmed patients who had an unknown source of transmission. We estimated that the basic reproductive number (R(0)) was 2.75 (95% CI: 2.37\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.23). The R(t) fluctuated within the range of 2.50 to 3.74 from January 11 to January 16 while gradually reached a peak of 3.74 on January 16. R(t) gradually decreased after January 16 and decreased to 1.00 on January 30. R(t) continually decreased and reached the lowest point (0.03) on February 21, 2020. CONCLUSION: Our study presented the possibility of asymptomatic carriers affected with SARS-CoV-2, and transmission by these three kinds of unconventional patients in Wenzhou may be an important characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The evaluation showed that a series of multifaceted interventions proved effective in controlling the epidemic of COVID-19. These findings might provide valuable examples of control policies for countries or areas in combatting the global pandemic of COVID-19.

However, HIV resistance to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) has been a major challenge for the current treatment of HIV/AIDS in China. METHODS: In the current study, we established a nested dynamic model to predict the multi-drug resistance dynamics of HIV among the heterosexual population and evaluated the impact of intervention measures on the transmission of drug resistance. We obtained an effective reproductive number [Image: see text] from each sub-model held at different stages of the dynamic model. Meanwhile, we applied Bayesian phylogenetic methods to infer the weighted average effective reproductive number [Image: see text] from four HIV subtypes that sampled from 912 HIV-positive patients in China. It is an original and innovative method by fitting [Image: see text] to [Image: see text] by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to generate unknown parameters in [Image: see text] . RESULTS: By analyzing the HIV gene sequences, we inferred that the most recent common ancestor of CRF01AE, CRF07BC, CRF08BC, and CRFBC dated from 1994, 1990, 1993 and 1990, respectively. The weighted average effective reproductive number [Image: see text] dropped from 1.95 in 1994 to 1.73 in 2018. Considering different interventions, we used a macro dynamic model to predict the trend of HIV resistance. The results show that the number of new infections and total drug resistance under the baseline parameter (S(1)) are 253,422 and 213,250 in 2025, respectively. Comparing with the numbers under the target treatment rate (S(2)), they were 219,717 and 236,890, respectively. However, under the ideal treatment target (S(3), the treatment rate reaches 90% and the treatment success rate reaches 90%), the number of new infections shows a declining trend and will decrease to 46,559 by 2025. Compared with S(1) and S(2), the total number of resistance also decreased to 160,899 in 2025. CONCLUSION: With the promotion of NFATP in China, HIV resistance to ARVs is inevitable. The strategy of increasing the treatment rate would not only ineffectively curb the epidemic, but also deteriorate drug resistance issue. Whereas, a combination of intervention strategies (the treatment rate reaches 90% and the treatment success rate reaches 90%) can greatly reduce both infection and drug resistance rate than applying one strategy alone.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

To date, the virus has infected tens of millions of people worldwide, compelling governments to implement strict policies to counteract community spread. Federal, provincial, and municipal governments have employed various public health policies, including social distancing, mandatory mask wearing, and the closure of schools and businesses. However, the implementation of these policies can be difficult and costly, making it imperative that both policy makers and the citizenry understand their potential benefits and the risks of non-compliance. In this work, a mathematical model is developed to study the impact of social behaviour on the course of the pandemic in the province of Ontario. The approach is based upon a standard SEIRD model with a variable transmission rate that depends on the behaviour of the population. The model parameters, which characterize the disease dynamics, are estimated from Ontario COVID-19 epidemiological data using machine learning techniques. A key result of the model, following from the variable transmission rate, is the prediction of the occurrence of a second wave using the most current infection data and disease-specific traits. The qualitative behaviour of different future transmission-reduction strategies is examined, and the time-varying reproduction number is analyzed using existing epidemiological data and future projections. Importantly, the effective reproduction number, and thus the course of the pandemic, is found to be sensitive to the adherence to public health policies, illustrating the need for vigilance as the economy continues to reopen.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Several data types can be used to inform transmission network inferences, yet the sensitivity of those inferences to different data types is not routinely evaluated. METHODS: The influence of different combinations of spatial, temporal, and travel-history data on transmission network inferences for Plasmodium falciparum malaria were evaluated. RESULTS: The information content of these data types may be limited for inferring person-to-person transmission networks and may lead to an overestimate of transmission. Only when outbreaks were temporally focal or travel histories were accurate was the algorithm able to accurately estimate the reproduction number under control, R(c). Applying this approach to data from Eswatini indicated that inferences of R(c) and spatiotemporal patterns therein depend upon the choice of data types and assumptions about travel-history data. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transmission network inferences made with routine malaria surveillance data should be interpreted with caution.

The problem is modelled by a system of six nonlinear ordinary differential equations describing the evolution of susceptible, exposed, infected and removed individuals. The wellposedness of the suggested model is established in terms of existence, positivity and boundedness of solutions. Four equilibrium points are given, namely the disease-free equilibrium, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 1, the endemic equilibrium with respect to strain 2, and the last endemic equilibrium with respect to both strains. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functional, the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium is proved depending on the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] . Furthermore, using other appropriate Lyapunov functionals, the global stability results of the endemic equilibria are established depending on the strain 1 reproduction number [Formula: see text] and the strain 2 reproduction number [Formula: see text] . Numerical simulations are performed in order to confirm the different theoretical results. It was observed that the model with a generalized incidence functions encompasses a large number of models with classical incidence functions and it gives a significant wide view about the equilibria stability. Numerical comparison between the model results and COVID-19 clinical data was conducted. Good fit of the model to the real clinical data was remarked. The impact of the quarantine strategy on controlling the infection spread is discussed. The generalization of the problem to a more complex compartmental model is illustrated at the end of this paper.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) adds to the urgency of developing effective means to reduce pathogen transmission in mass-gathering public buildings such as schools, hospitals, and airports. To inform occupants and guide facility managers to prevent and respond to infectious disease outbreaks, this study proposed a framework to assess room-level outbreak risks in buildings by modeling built environment characteristics, occupancy information, and pathogen transmission. Building information modeling (BIM) is exploited to automatically retrieve building parameters and possible occupant interactions that are relevant to pathogen transmission. The extracted information is fed into an environment pathogen transmission model to derive the basic reproduction numbers for different pathogens, which serve as proxies of outbreak potentials in rooms. A web-based system is developed to provide timely information regarding outbreak risks to occupants and facility managers. The efficacy of the proposed method was demonstrated by a case study, in which building characteristics, occupancy schedules, pathogen parameters, as well as hygiene and cleaning practices are considered for outbreak risk assessment. This study contributes to the body of knowledge by computationally integrating building, occupant, and pathogen information modeling for infectious disease outbreak assessment, and communicating actionable information for built environment management.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We hypothesized that patients with dilated pancreatic ducts have improved postoperative outcomes with MIPD compared to OPD. METHODS: All patients undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy were prospectively followed over a time period of 47 months, and perioperative and pathologic covariates and outcomes were compared. Ideal outcome after PD was defined as follows: (1) no complications, (2) postoperative length of stay < 7 days, and (3) negative (R0) margins on pathology. Patients with dilated pancreatic ducts (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a5 3 mm) who underwent MIPD were 1:3 propensity score-matched to patients with dilated ducts who underwent OPD and outcomes compared.

Overall, patients who underwent MIPD had significantly less intraoperative blood loss. After 1:3 propensity score matching, patients with dilated pancreatic ducts who underwent MIPD (n = 45) had significantly lower overall complication and 90-day readmission rates compared to matched OPD patients (n = 135) with dilated ducts. Patients with dilated duct who underwent MIPD were more likely to have an ideal outcome than patients with OPD (29 vs 15%, p = 0.035). There were no significant differences in postoperative outcomes among propensity score-matched patients with non-dilated pancreatic ducts who underwent MIPD (n = 29) compared to matched patients undergoing OPD (n = 87) with non-dilated ducts.

The UK Government implemented the biggest lockdown of society during peacetime in British history at the end of March 2020, aiming to contain the rapid spread of the virus. The UK lockdown was maintained for 7 weeks, but the effectiveness of the control measures in suppressing disease transmission remains incompletely understood. METHODS: A Bayesian SEIR (susceptible-exposed-infected-removed) epidemiological model was used to rebuild the local transmission dynamics of the spread of COVID-19 in nine regions of England. RESULTS: The basic reproduction number (R0) in England was found to be relatively high compared with China. The estimate of the temporally varying effective reproduction number (Rt) suggests that the control measures, especially the forced lockdown, were effective to reduce transmissibility and curb the COVID-19 epidemic. Although the overall incidence rate in the UK has declined, forecasting highlights the possibility of a second epidemic wave in several regions.

It takes two forms: one is local, namely diffusion in space, and other is related to travel. With the advancement of transportation system, it is possible for diseases to move from one place to an entirely separate place very quickly. In a developing country like India, the mass movement of large numbers of individuals creates the possibility of spread of common infectious diseases. This has led to the study of infectious disease model to describe the infection during transport. An SIRS-type epidemic model is formulated to illustrate the dynamics of such infectious disease propagation between two cities due to population dispersal. The most important threshold parameter, namely the basic reproduction number, is derived, and the possibility of existence of backward bifurcation is examined, as the existence of backward bifurcation is very unsettling for disease control and it is vital to know from modeling analysis when it can occur. It is shown that dispersal of populations would make the disease control difficult in comparison with nondispersal case. Optimal vaccination and treatment controls are determined. Further to find the best cost-effective strategy, cost-effectiveness analysis is also performed.

These containment efforts often lead to changes in the contact pattern among individuals of the population. Many existing compartmental epidemic models fail to account for the effects of contact structure. In this paper, we devised a pairwise epidemic model to analyze the COVID-19 outbreak in China based on confirmed cases reported during the period February 3rd--17th, 2020. By explicitly incorporating the effects of family clusters and contact tracing followed by household quarantine and isolation, our model provides a good fit to the trajectory of COVID-19 infections and is useful to predict the epidemic trend. We obtained the average of the reproduction number $R=1.494$ ($95\\%$ CI: $1.483-1.507$) for Hubei province and $R=1.178$ ($95\\%$ CI: $1.145-1.158$) for China (except Hubei), suggesting that some existing studies may have overestimated the reproduction number by neglecting the dynamical correlations and clustering effects. We forecasted that the COVID-19 epidemic would peak on February 13th ($95\\%$ CI: February $9-17$th) in Hubei and 6 days eariler in the regions outside Hubei. Moreover the epidemic was expected to last until the middle of March in China (except Hubei) and late April in Hubei. The sensitivity analysis shows that ongoing exposure for the susceptible and population clustering play an important role in the disease propagation. With the enforcement of household quarantine measures, the reproduction number $R$ effectively reduces and epidemic quantities decrease accordingly. Furthermore, we gave an answer to the public concern on how long the stringent containment strategies should maintain. Through numerical analysis, we suggested that the time for the resumption of work and production in China (except Hubei) and Hubei would be the middle of March and the end of April, 2020, respectively.

To render an accurate assessment, we have devised a state-space method for fitting a discrete-time variant of the Hawkes process to a given dataset of daily confirmed cases.

We assessed the effectiveness of containment measures by estimating transmissibility (effective reproduction number, (Equation is included in full-text article.)) over the course of the outbreak. METHODS: We used a Bayesian data augmentation framework to allocate infectors to infectees with no known infectors and determine serial interval distribution parameters via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. We fitted a smoothing spline to the number of secondary cases generated by each infector by respective onset dates to estimate (Equation is included in full-text article.)and evaluated increase in mean number of secondary cases per individual for each day's delay in starting isolation or quarantine. RESULTS: As of April 1, 2020, 1000 COVID-19 cases were reported in Singapore. We estimated a mean serial interval of 4.6 days [95% credible interval (CI) = 4.2, 5.1] with a SD of 3.5 days (95% CI = 3.1, 4.0). The posterior mean (Equation is included in full-text article.)was below one for most of the time, peaking at 1.1 (95% CI = 1.0, 1.3) on week 9 of 2020 due to a spreading event in one of the clusters.

By mid-September of 2020, the number of daily new infections in India have crossed 95,000. To facilitate an intuition for the spatio-temporal development of the pandemic and to help resource deployment planning, we analyze and describe how the disease burden almost-predictably shifted from large metropolitan districts to sub-urban districts. Methods. We gathered the publicly available granular data from 186 different districts (equivalent of counties) on their COVID-19 infections and deaths during the 15 April to 31 August 2020 period. These districts presented an active case burden of 559,566 and a cumulative 2,715,656 infections as of August 31. The epidemiological data of these districts was fit to a susceptible-asymptomatic-infected-recovered-dead (SAIRD) model and the underlying epidemic parameters for each of these districts during the course of 4 months was estimated. We validated these parameters against known epidemiological characteristic distributions and analyzed them to understand their changes in space-time during the pandemic. Findings. The center of the burden of the current-active infections which on May 15 was in the large metro districts with most international access shifted continuously and smoothly shifted towards districts which could be accessed by domestic airports and by trains. A linear trend-analysis showed a continuous improvement in most epidemic parameters consistently across the districts with four categories of accessibility from an international travel perspective - large metro, metro, urban and sub-urban districts. The reproduction numbers improved from 1.77{+/-}0.58 on May 15 to 1.07{+/-} 0.13 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0001053); and from 1.58{+/-}0.39 on May 15 to 0.94{+/-}0.11 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.0067). The recovery rate per infected person per day improved from 0.0581{+/-}0.009 on May 15 to 0.091{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.26.10^{-12}); and from 0.059{+/-}0.011 on May 15 to 0.100{+/-}0.010 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.12.10{-16}). The death rate of symptomatic individuals which includes the case-fatality-rate as well as the time from symptoms to death, consistently decreased from 0.0025{+/-}0.0014 on May 15 to 0.0013{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in large metro districts (p-Value of trend 0.0010); and from 0.0018{+/-}0.0008 on May 15 to 0.0014{+/-}0.0003 on August 31 in sub-urban districts (p-Value of trend 0.2789. Interpretation. As the daily infections continue to rise at a national level, it is important to notice a `local-flattening' in larger metro districts, and a shift of the pandemic-burden towards smaller sized districts in a clear hierarchical fashion of accessibility from an international travel perspective. The pandemic burden shifting towards remotely accessible regions, with possibly lesser health care facilities, is a call for attention to the re-organization of resources.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Could Deficiencies in South African Data Be the Explanation for Its Early SARS-CoV-2 Peak?\nThe SARS-CoV-2 pandemic peaked very early in comparison to the thresholds predicted by an analysis of prior lockdown regimes. The most convenient explanation is that some, external factor changed the value of the basic reproduction number, r0; and there certainly are arguments for this. Other factors could, nonetheless, have played a role. This research attempts to reconcile the observed peak with the thresholds predicted by lockdown regimes similar to the one in force at the time. It contemplates the effect of two, different, hypothetical errors in the data: The first is that the true level of infection has been underestimated by a multiplicative factor, while the second is that of an imperceptible, pre-existing, immune fraction of the population. While it is shown that it certainly is possible to manufacture the perception of an early peak as extreme as the one observed, solely by way of these two phenomena, the values need to be fairly high. The phenomena would not, by any measure, be insignificant. It also remains an inescapable fact that the early peak in infections coincided with a fairly profound change in r0; in all the contemplated scenarios of data-deficiency.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We evaluated strategies to reduce SARS-CoV-2 burden in African countries, so as to support decisions that balance minimising mortality, protecting health services and safeguarding livelihoods. METHODS: We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered mathematical model, stratified by age, to predict the evolution of COVID-19 epidemics in three countries representing a range of age distributions in Africa (from oldest to youngest average age: Mauritius, Nigeria and Niger), under various effectiveness assumptions for combinations of different non-pharmaceutical interventions: self-isolation of symptomatic people, physical distancing and \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153shielding\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 (physical isolation) of the high-risk population. We adapted model parameters to better represent uncertainty about what might be expected in African populations, in particular by shifting the distribution of severity risk towards younger ages and increasing the case-fatality ratio. We also present sensitivity analyses for key model parameters subject to uncertainty. RESULTS: We predicted median symptomatic attack rates over the first 12 months of 23% (Niger) to 42% (Mauritius), peaking at 2\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 months, if epidemics were unmitigated. Self-isolation while symptomatic had a maximum impact of about 30% on reducing severe cases, while the impact of physical distancing varied widely depending on percent contact reduction and R(0). The effect of shielding high-risk people, e.g. by rehousing them in physical isolation, was sensitive mainly to residual contact with low-risk people, and to a lesser extent to contact among shielded individuals. Mitigation strategies incorporating self-isolation of symptomatic individuals, moderate physical distancing and high uptake of shielding reduced predicted peak bed demand and mortality by around 50%. Lockdowns delayed epidemics by about 3 months. Estimates were sensitive to differences in age-specific social mixing patterns, as published in the literature, and assumptions on transmissibility, infectiousness of asymptomatic cases and risk of severe disease or death by age. CONCLUSIONS: In African settings, as elsewhere, current evidence suggests large COVID-19 epidemics are expected. However, African countries have fewer means to suppress transmission and manage cases. We found that self-isolation of symptomatic persons and general physical distancing are unlikely to avert very large epidemics, unless distancing takes the form of stringent lockdown measures. However, both interventions help to mitigate the epidemic. Shielding of high-risk individuals can reduce health service demand and, even more markedly, mortality if it features high uptake and low contact of shielded and unshielded people, with no increase in contact among shielded people. Strategies combining self-isolation, moderate physical distancing and shielding could achieve substantial reductions in mortality in African countries. Temporary lockdowns, where socioeconomically acceptable, can help gain crucial time for planning and expanding health service capacity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The mechanisms behind this association remain elusive.METHODSWe evaluated the relationship between SARS-CoV-2 viremia, disease outcome, and inflammatory and proteomic profiles in a cohort of COVID-19 emergency department participants. SARS-CoV-2 viral load was measured using a quantitative reverse transcription PCR-based platform. Proteomic data were generated with Proximity Extension Assay using the Olink platform.RESULTSThis study included 300 participants with nucleic acid test-confirmed COVID-19. Plasma SARS-CoV-2 viremia levels at the time of presentation predicted adverse disease outcomes, with an adjusted OR of 10.6 (95% CI 4.4-25.5, P < 0.001) for severe disease (mechanical ventilation and/or 28-day mortality) and 3.9 (95% CI 1.5-10.1, P = 0.006) for 28-day mortality. Proteomic analyses revealed prominent proteomic pathways associated with SARS-CoV-2 viremia, including upregulation of SARS-CoV-2 entry factors (ACE2, CTSL, FURIN), heightened markers of tissue damage to the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and endothelium/vasculature, and alterations in coagulation pathways.CONCLUSIONThese results highlight the cascade of vascular and tissue damage associated with SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia that underlies its ability to predict COVID-19 disease outcomes.FUNDINGMark and Lisa Schwartz; the National Institutes of Health (U19AI082630); the American Lung Association; the Executive Committee on Research at Massachusetts General Hospital; the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative; Arthur, Sandra, and Sarah Irving for the David P.

The exact reproduction number Rt for these VOCs is important to determine appropriate control measures. Here, we estimated the transmissibility for VOCs and lineages of SAR-CoV-2 based on genomic data and Bayesian inference under an epidemiological model to infer the reproduction number (Rt). We analyzed data for multiple VOCs from the same time period and countries, in order to compare their transmissibility while controlling for geographical and temporal factors. The lineage B had a significantly higher transmissibility than lineage A, and contributed to the global pandemic to a large extent. In addition, all VOCs had increased transmissibility when compared with other lineages in each country, indicating they are harder to control and present a high risk to public health. All countries should formulate specific prevention and control policies for these VOCs when they are detected to curve their potential for large-scale spread.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Such structural variables are well documented to be fundamental for the transmission of human-mosquitoes malaria infections. Here we formulate an age-structured model accounting for the three structural variables. Using integrated semigroups theory, we first handle the well-posedness of the model proposed. We also investigate the existence of model's steady-states. A disease-free equilibrium always exists while the existence of endemic equilibria is discussed. We derive the threshold R0 (the basic reproduction number). The expression of the R0 obtained here particularly highlight the effect of above structural variables on key important epidemiological traits of the human-vector association. This includes, humans and mosquitoes transmission probability and survival rates. Next, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition that implies the bifurcation of an endemic equilibrium. In some configuration where the age-structure of the human population is neglected, we show that, depending on the sign of some constant Cbif given by the parameters, a bifurcation occurs at R0 = 1 that is either forward or backward. In the former case, it means that there exists a (unique) endemic equilibrium if and only if R0>1. In the latter case, no endemic equilibrium exists for R0<<1 small enough, a unique exists if R0>1 while multiple endemic equilibria exist when 0<<R0<1 close enough to 1.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, few studies have accounted for the nature of contagious diseases, i.e., their dependent happenings. Aim We aimed to quantify the impact of temperature on the transmissibility and virulence of COVID-19 in Tokyo, Japan. We employed two epidemiological measurements of transmissibility and severity: the effective reproduction number (Rt) and case fatality risk (CFR). Methods We used empirical surveillance data and meteorological data in Tokyo to estimate the Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR and to subsequently assess the nonlinear and delay effect of temperature on Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR. Results For Rt at low temperatures, the cumulative relative risk (RR) at first temperature percentile (3.3) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.1-1.7). As for the virulence to humans, moderate cold temperatures were associated with higher CFR, and CFR also increased as the temperature rose. The cumulative RR at the 10th and 99th percentiles of temperature (5.8 and 30.8) for CFR were 3.5 (95%CI: 1.3-10) and 6.4 (95%CI: 4.1-10.1). Conclusions This study provided information on the effects of temperature on the COVID-19 epidemiology using Rt and time-delay adjusted CFR. Our results suggest the importance to take precautions to avoid infection in both cold and warm seasons to avoid severe cases of COVID-19.

Italy installed a successful nationwide lockdown to mitigate the exponential increase of case numbers, as the basic reproduction number R0 reached 1 within 4 weeks. But is R0 really the relevant criterion as to whether or not community spreading is under control? In most parts of the world, testing largely focused on symptomatic cases, and we thus hypothesized that the true number of infected cases and relative testing capacity are better determinants to guide lockdown exit strategies. We employed the SEIR model to estimate the numbers of undocumented cases. As expected, the estimated numbers of all cases largely exceeded the reported ones in all Italian regions. Next, we used the numbers of reported and estimated cases per million of population and compared it with the respective numbers of tests. In Lombardy, as the most affected region, testing capacity per reported new case seemed between two and eight most of the time, but testing capacity per estimated new cases never reached four up to April 30. In contrast, Veneto\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153s testing capacity per reported and estimated new cases were much less discrepant and were between four and 16 most of the time. As per April 30 also Marche, Lazio and other Italian regions arrived close to 16 ratio of test capacity per new estimated infection. Thus, the criterion to exit a lockdown should be decided at the level of the regions, based on the local testing capacity that should reach 16 times the estimated true number of newly infected cases as predicted.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In many instances, it is of practical importance to evaluate time-dependent variations in the transmission potential of infectious diseases. Explanation of the time course of an epidemic can be partly achieved by estimating the effective reproduction number, R(t), defined as the actual average number of secondary cases per primary case at calendar time t (for t >0). R(t) shows time-dependent variation due to the decline in susceptible individuals (intrinsic factors) and the implementation of control measures (extrinsic factors). If R(t)<1, it suggests that the epidemic is in decline and may be regarded as being under control at time t (vice versa, if R(t)>1). This chapter describes the primer of mathematics and statistics of R(t) and discusses other similar markers of transmissibility as a function of time.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In addition, it explores the use of the positivity rate as an indicator for the spread of COVID-19. METHODS We used COVID-19 datasets for eight countries, including Canada, USA, UK, Italy, Belgium, Ireland, Colombia, and South Africa, and considered two correlation cases. The first case considers the correlation of the number of confirmed cases with each of the deaths and ICU patients. The second case considers the correlation of the positivity rate with each of the deaths and ICU patients. When obtaining the correlation, we considered different lagging periods between the date of confirming a case and the date of its ICU admittance or death. We compared the obtained correlation coefficient values for each of the two considered cases to explore whether the positivity rate is a better indicator for the spread of the disease than the confirmed cases. For each of the eight considered countries, we obtained the daily reproduction number using each of the confirmed cases and the positivity rate. The two obtained sets of reproduction number values for each country were statistically compared to investigate whether they are significantly different. RESULTS When considering the daily positivity rate instead of the daily number of confirmed cases, the maximum correlation with the deaths is increased by 349.9% for the USA (the country with the highest increase) and 4.5% for the UK (the country with the lowest increase), with an average increase of 60.8% considering the eight countries. Considering the daily positivity rate instead of the daily number of confirmed cases caused the maximum correlation with the number of ICU patients to be increased by 74.7% for the USA (the country with the highest increase) and 2.2% for the UK (the country with the lowest increase), with an average increase of 25% over the considered countries. The results for the daily reproduction number obtained using the positivity rate are statistically different from those obtained using daily confirmed cases. CONCLUSION The results indicate that the positivity rate is a better indicator for the spread of the disease than the number of confirmed cases. Therefore, it is highly advised to use measures based on the positivity rate when indicating the spread of the disease and considering responses accordingly because these measures consider the daily number of tests and the confirmed cases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We sought to further understand RTS,S/AS01-induced immune responses associated with vaccine protection. METHODS: Applying the blood transcriptional module (BTM) framework, we characterized the transcriptomic response to RTS,S/AS01 vaccination in antigen-stimulated (and vehicle control) peripheral blood mononuclear cells sampled from a subset of trial participants at baseline and month 3 (1-month post-third dose). Using a matched case\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153control study design, we evaluated which of these \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153RTS,S/AS01 signature BTMs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 associated with malaria case status in RTS,S/AS01 vaccinees. Antigen-specific T-cell responses were analyzed by flow cytometry. We also performed a cross-study correlates analysis where we assessed the generalizability of our findings across three controlled human malaria infection studies of healthy, malaria-naive adult RTS,S/AS01 recipients. RESULTS: RTS,S/AS01 vaccination was associated with downregulation of B-cell and monocyte-related BTMs and upregulation of T-cell-related BTMs, as well as higher month 3 (vs. baseline) circumsporozoite protein-specific CD4(+) T-cell responses. There were few RTS,S/AS01-associated BTMs whose month 3 levels correlated with malaria risk. In contrast, baseline levels of BTMs associated with dendritic cells and with monocytes (among others) correlated with malaria risk. The baseline dendritic cell- and monocyte-related BTM correlations with malaria risk appeared to generalize to healthy, malaria-naive adults. CONCLUSIONS: A prevaccination transcriptomic signature associates with malaria in RTS,S/AS01-vaccinated African children, and elements of this signature may be broadly generalizable. The consistent presence of monocyte-related modules suggests that certain monocyte subsets may inhibit protective RTS,S/AS01-induced responses.

METHODS: In this study, we applied two existing epidemiological models, an extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Removed model (eSIR) and SAPHIRE, to fit the daily ascertained infected (and removed) cases from March 15 to July 31 in South Africa. To combine the desirable features from the two models, we further extended the eSIR model to an eSEIRD model. RESULTS: Using the eSEIRD model, the COVID-19 transmission dynamics in South Africa was characterized by the estimated basic reproduction number (R(0)) at 2.10 (95%CI: [2.09,2.10]). The decrease of effective reproduction number with time implied the effectiveness of interventions. The low estimated ascertained rate was found to be 2.17% (95%CI: [2.15%, 2.19%]) in the eSEIRD model. The overall infection fatality ratio (IFR) was estimated as 0.04% (95%CI: [0.02%, 0.06%]) while the reported case fatality ratio was 4.40% (95% CI: [<0.01%, 11.81%]). As of December 31, 2020, the cumulative number of ascertained cases and total infected would reach roughly 801 thousand and 36.9 million according to the long-term forecasting. CONCLUSIONS: The dynamics based on our models suggested a decline of COVID-19 infection and that the severeness of the epidemic might be largely mitigated through strict interventions. Besides providing insights on the COVID-19 dynamics in South Africa, we develop powerful forecasting tools that allow incorporating ascertained rate and IFR estimation and inquiring into the effect of intervention measures on COVID-19 spread.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Understanding super-spreading would be useful to reduce future transmission. Some publications have shown clusters of SARS-CoV-2 such as at choir practice and in hospitals. Aerosol can be considered as a primary transmission route. As SARS-CoV-2 stability in aerosol is similar to SARS-CoV-1 with the higher reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 than SARS-CoV-1, another factor causes rapidly spread-out, e.g. a higher discharge ratio from infected people or a higher viral intake ratio to human body. A basic research suggests higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 in the nose than the peripheral lung. Universal masking would be important to prevent the exposure of SARS-CoV-2 droplet to uninfected people. To detect SARS-CoV-2 infection, laboratory tests such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays are applied. Although sensitivity and specificity are provided for the ability of the test, positive or negative prediction values are useful to indicate the possiblity of infection or non-infection in clinical practice. We have to realize that the positive and negative prediction values depend on the sensitivity, specificity, and infection probability of the patient.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Our recent in vitro, and in vivo coronaviral pathogenesis studies involving Mouse Hepatitis Virus (MHV-A59) suggest a crucial role for a small host membrane-virus contact initiator region of the Spike protein, called the fusion peptide that enhances the virus fusogenicity and infectivity. Here we study the Spike from five human \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-coronaviruses (HCoV) including the SARS-CoV-2, and MHV-A59 for comparison. The structural and dynamics analyses of the Spike show that its fusion loop spatially organizes three fusion peptides contiguous to each other to synergistically trigger the virus-host membrane fusion process. We propose a Contact Initiation Model based on the architecture of the Spike quaternary structure that explains the obligatory participation of the fusion loop in the initiation of the host membrane contact for the virus fusion process. Among all the HCoV Spikes in this study, SARS-CoV-2 has the most hydrophobic surface and the extent of hydrophobicity correlates with the reproductive number and infectivity of the other HCoV. Comparison between results from standard and replica exchange molecular dynamics reveal the unique physicochemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides, accrued in part from the presence of consecutive prolines that impart backbone rigidity which aids the virus fusogenicity. The priming of the Spike by its cleavage and subsequent fusogenic conformational transition steered by the fusion loop may be critical for the SARS-CoV-2 spread. The importance of the fusion loop makes it an apt target for anti-virals and vaccine candidates.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

For the deterministic, mean-field model, the basic reproductive number $R_0$ determines their global dynamics. If $R_0\\le 1$, then the frequency of infected individuals asymptotically converges to zero. If $R_0>1$, then the infectious class uniformly persists for all time; conditions for a globally stable, endemic equilibrium are given. In contrast, the infection goes extinct in finite time with probability one in the stochastic models for all $R_0$ values. To understand the length of the transient prior to extinction as well as the behavior of the transients, the quasi-stationary distributions and the associated mean time to extinction are analyzed using large deviation methods. When $R_0>1$, these mean times to extinction are shown to increase exponentially with the population size $N$. Moreover, as $N$ approaches $\\infty$, the quasi-stationary distributions are supported by a compact set bounded away from extinction; sufficient conditions for convergence to a Dirac measure at the endemic equilibrium of the deterministic model are also given. In contrast, when $R_0<1$, the mean times to extinction are bounded above $1/(1-\\alpha)$ where $\\alpha<1$ is the geometric rate of decrease of the infection when rare; as $N$ approaches $\\infty$, the quasi-stationary distributions converge to a Dirac measure at the disease-free equilibrium for the deterministic model. For several special cases, explicit formulas for approximating the quasi-stationary distribution and the associated mean extinction are given. These formulas illustrate how for arbitrarily small $R_0$ values, the mean time to extinction can be arbitrarily large, and how for arbitrarily large $R_0$ values, the mean time to extinction can be arbitrarily large.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of the world. METHODS: To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the beginning of March or April). FINDINGS: Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66-97) and 24% (13-90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic. INTERPRETATION: Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis, including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

Outcomes of such policies depend on a complex combination of local epidemic conditions and demographic features as well as the intensity and timing of such policies and are therefore unclear. OBJECTIVE: To use a decision analytical model of the COVID-19 epidemic to investigate potential outcomes if actual policies enacted in March 2020 (during the first wave of the epidemic) in the St Louis region of Missouri had been delayed. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A previously developed, publicly available, open-source modeling platform (Local Epidemic Modeling for Management & Action, version 2.1) designed to enable localized COVID-19 epidemic projections was used. The compartmental epidemic model is programmed in R and Stan, uses bayesian inference, and accepts user-supplied demographic, epidemiologic, and policy inputs. Hospital census data for 1.3 million people from St Louis City and County from March 14, 2020, through July 15, 2020, were used to calibrate the model. EXPOSURES: Hypothetical delays in actual social distancing policies (which began on March 13, 2020) by 1, 2, or 4 weeks. Sensitivity analyses were conducted that explored plausible spontaneous behavior change in the absence of social distancing policies. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hospitalizations and deaths. RESULTS: A model of 1.3 million residents of the greater St Louis, Missouri, area found an initial reproductive number (indicating transmissibility of an infectious agent) of 3.9 (95% credible interval [CrI], 3.1-4.5) in the St Louis region before March 15, 2020, which fell to 0.93 (95% CrI, 0.88-0.98) after social distancing policies were implemented between March 15 and March 21, 2020. By June 15, a 1-week delay in policies would have increased cumulative hospitalizations from an observed actual number of 2246 hospitalizations to 8005 hospitalizations (75% CrI: 3973-15 236 hospitalizations) and increased deaths from an observed actual number of 482 deaths to a projected 1304 deaths (75% CrI, 656-2428 deaths). By June 15, a 2-week delay would have yielded 3292 deaths (75% CrI, 2104-4905 deaths)\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dan additional 2810 deaths or a 583% increase beyond what was actually observed. Sensitivity analyses incorporating a range of spontaneous behavior changes did not avert severe epidemic projections. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The results of this decision analytical model study suggest that, in the St Louis region, timely social distancing policies were associated with improved population health outcomes, and small delays may likely have led to a COVID-19 epidemic similar to the most heavily affected areas in the US. These findings indicate that an open-source modeling platform designed to accept user-supplied local and regional data may provide projections tailored to, and more relevant for, local settings.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We developed a stochastic, compartmental model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in a 100-bed nursing home with a staff of 99 healthcare personnel (HCP) in a community of 20,000 people. We parameterized admission and discharge of residents in the model with CMS data, for a within-facility basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) of 3.5 and a community [Formula: see text] of 2.5. The model also included: importation of COVID-19 from the community, isolation of SARS-CoV-2 positive residents, facility-wide adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) use by HCP, and testing. We systematically varied coverage of mRNA vaccine among residents, HCP, and the community. Simulations were run for 6 months after the second dose in the facility, with results summarized over 1,000 simulations. Expected resident cases decreased as community vaccination increased, with large reductions at high HCP coverage. The probability of a COVID-19 outbreak was lower as well: at HCP vaccination coverage of 60%, probability of an outbreak was below 20% for community coverage of 50% or above. At high coverage, stopping asymptomatic screening and facility-wide testing yielded similar results. Results suggest that high coverage among HCP and in the community can prevent infections in residents. When vaccination is high in nursing homes, but not in their surrounding communities, asymptomatic and facility-wide testing remains necessary to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

In the post-lockdown period, the mean number of contacts increased by 5 to 17% as compared to the lockdown period. However, it remains three to seven times lower than its pre-pandemic level sufficient to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We find that the impact of school interventions depends nonlinearly on the intensity of other activities. When most community activities are halted, school closure leads to a 77% decrease in the reproduction number; in contrast, when social mixing outside of schools is at pre-pandemic level, school closure leads to a 5% reduction in transmission.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Many emerging zoonoses, such as SARS, Nipah, and Hendra, mutated from their wild type while circulating in an intermediate host population, usually a domestic species, to become more transmissible among humans, and this transmission route will only become more likely as agriculture and trade intensifies around the world. Passage through an intermediate host enables many otherwise rare diseases to become better adapted to humans, and so understanding this process with accurate mathematical models is necessary to prevent epidemics of emerging zoonoses, guide policy interventions in public health, and predict the behavior of an epidemic. In this paper, we account for a zoonotic disease mutating in an intermediate host by introducing a new mathematical model for disease transmission among three species. We present a model of these disease dynamics, including the equilibria of the system and the basic reproductive number of the pathogen, finding that in the presence of biologically realistic interspecies transmission parameters, a zoonotic disease with the capacity to mutate in an intermediate host population can establish itself in humans even if its R(0) in humans is less than 1. This result and model can be used to predict the behavior of any zoonosis with an intermediate host and assist efforts to protect public health.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Response to COVID-19 in South Korea and implications for lifting stringent interventions\nBACKGROUND: After experiencing a sharp growth in COVID-19 cases early in the pandemic, South Korea rapidly controlled transmission while implementing less stringent national social distancing measures than countries in Europe and the USA. This has led to substantial interest in their \"test, trace, isolate\" strategy. However, it is important to understand the epidemiological peculiarities of South Korea's outbreak and characterise their response before attempting to emulate these measures elsewhere. METHODS: We systematically extracted numbers of suspected cases tested, PCR-confirmed cases, deaths, isolated confirmed cases, and numbers of confirmed cases with an identified epidemiological link from publicly available data. We estimated the time-varying reproduction number, Rt, using an established Bayesian framework, and reviewed the package of interventions implemented by South Korea using our extracted data, plus published literature and government sources. RESULTS: We estimated that after the initial rapid growth in cases, Rt dropped below one in early April before increasing to a maximum of 1.94 (95%CrI, 1.64-2.27) in May following outbreaks in Seoul Metropolitan Region. By mid-June, Rt was back below one where it remained until the end of our study (July 13th). Despite less stringent \"lockdown\" measures, strong social distancing measures were implemented in high-incidence areas and studies measured a considerable national decrease in movement in late February. Testing the capacity was swiftly increased, and protocols were in place to isolate suspected and confirmed cases quickly; however, we could not estimate the delay to isolation using our data. Accounting for just 10% of cases, individual case-based contact tracing picked up a relatively minor proportion of total cases, with cluster investigations accounting for 66%. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst early adoption of testing and contact tracing is likely to be important for South Korea's successful outbreak control, other factors including regional implementation of strong social distancing measures likely also contributed. The high volume of testing and the low number of deaths suggest that South Korea experienced a small epidemic relative to other countries. Caution is needed in attempting to replicate the South Korean response in populations with larger more geographically widespread epidemics where finding, testing, and isolating cases that are linked to clusters may be more difficult.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In all cases, these are zoonoses passing the barrier between species and infect humans. The legitimate concern of the international community is due to the fact that the new identified coronavirus, named SARS-CoV-2 (previously called 2019-nCoV), has a quite high mortality rate, around 2%, and a strong ability to spread, with an estimated reproduction number higher than 2. Even though all countries are doing their utmost to stop the pandemic, the only reliable solution to tackle the infection is the rapid development of a vaccine. For this purpose, the means of bioinformatics, applied in the context of reverse-vaccinology paradigm, can be of fundamental help to select the most promising peptides able to trigger an effective immune response. In this short report, using the concept of nullomer and introducing a distance from human self, we provide a list of peptides that could deserve experimental investigation in the view of a potential vaccine for SARS-CoV-2.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The pathogenesis of MIS-C remains undefined, and whether specific inflammatory biomarker patterns can distinguish MIS-C from other hyperinflammatory syndromes including Kawasaki disease (KD) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is unknown.Methods: We studied a prospective cohort of nineteen MIS-C and nine KD patients and an established cohort of eleven new onset SJIA and nine MAS associated SJIA patients. Clinical and laboratory features as well as S100A8/A9, S100A12, IL-18, CXCL9 and IL-6 levels were compared between disease groups.Findings: KD and MIS-C patients have similar S100 proteins and IL-18 profiles but are distinguished by significantly higher levels of the IFN-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3-induced chemokine CXCL9 in MIS-C. Stratifying MIS-C patients by CXCL9 levels revealed differential severity of clinical and laboratory presentation. MIS-C with high CXCL9 levels was associated with acute kidney injury, altered mental status, a higher frequency of shock (40 vs 90%), myocardial dysfunction (20 vs 50%), and more severe systemic inflammatory markers, cytopenia, and coagulopathy. The low CXCL9 MIS-C group in contrast resembled KD patients including the frequency of coronary involvement. We also found that elevated S100A8/A9, S100A12 and IL-18 were useful in distinguishing SJIA from KD with high sensitivity and specificity.Interpretation: Our findings show MIS-C is distinguished from KD primarily by elevated CXCL9. The stratification of CXCL9 levels of MIS-C patients provides support for MAS pathophysiology in patients with severe MIS-C, suggesting new approaches for diagnosis and management.Funding: This work was supported by an Academic Research Clinical (ARC) award to AG and GS from the Cincinnati Children\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s Research Foundation.

This study aimed to evaluate the risk of outbreak in mass religious gathering and further to assess the preparedness of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) for preventing COVID-19 outbreak in this context. METHODS: The risk of COVID-19 outbreak in mass religious gathering was evaluated by using secondary COVID-19 cases and reproductive numbers. The preparedness of a series of NPIs for preventing COVID-19 outbreak in mass religious gathering was then assessed by using a density-dependent model. This approach was first illustrated by the Mazu Pilgrimage in Taiwan and validated by using the COVID-19 outbreak in the Shincheonji Church of Jesus (SCJ) religious gathering in South Korea. RESULTS: Through the strict implementation of 80% NPIs in the Mazu Pilgrimage, the number of secondary cases can be substantially reduced from 1508 (95% CI: 900-2176) to 294 (95% CI: 169-420) with the reproductive number (R) significantly below one (0.54, 95% CI: 0.31-0.78), indicating an effective containment of outbreak. The expected number of secondary COVID-19 cases in the SCJ gathering was estimated as 232 (basic reproductive number (R0) = 6.02) and 579 (R0 = 2.50) for the first and second outbreak, respectively, with a total expected cases (833) close to the observed data on high infection of COVID-19 cases (887, R0 = 3.00).

METHODS: Python 3.7.1 was used to write a SEIR class to model the epidemic procedure and proportional estimation method to estimate the initial true infected number. The epidemic area in China was divided into three parts, Wuhan city, Hubei province (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei) based on the different transmission pattern. A testing capacity limitation factor for medical resources was imposed to model the number of infected but not quarantined individuals. Baidu migration data were used to assess the number of infected individuals who migrated from Wuhan to other areas. RESULTS: Basic reproduction number, R0, was 3.6 before the city was lockdown on Jan 23, 2020. The actual infected number the model predicted was 4508 in Wuhan before Jan 23, 2020. By January 22 2020, it was estimated that 1764 infected cases migrated from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei province. Effective reproductive number, R, gradually decreased from 3.6 (Wuhan), 3.4 (Hubei except Wuhan,) and 3.3 (China except Hubei) in stage 1 (from Dec 08, 2019 to Jan 22, 2020) to 0.67 (Wuhan), 0.59 (Hubei except Wuhan) and 0.63 (China except Hubei) respectively. Especially after January 23, 2020 when Wuhan City was closed, the infected number showed a turning point in Wuhan. By early April, there would be 42073 (95% confidence interval, 41673 to 42475), 21342 (95% confidence interval, 21057 to 21629) and 13384 (95% confidence interval, 13158 to 13612) infected cases in Wuhan, Hubei (except Wuhan) and China (except Hubei), respectively.

While sustained transmission chains of human-to-human transmission suggest high basic reproduction number R 0, variation in the number of secondary transmissions (often characterised by so-called superspreading events) may be large as some countries have observed fewer local transmissions than others. Methods: We quantified individual-level variation in COVID-19 transmission by applying a mathematical model to observed outbreak sizes in affected countries. We extracted the number of imported and local cases in the affected countries from the World Health Organization situation report and applied a branching process model where the number of secondary transmissions was assumed to follow a negative-binomial distribution. Results: Our model suggested a high degree of individual-level variation in the transmission of COVID-19. Within the current consensus range of R 0 (2-3), the overdispersion parameter k of a negative-binomial distribution was estimated to be around 0.1 (median estimate 0.1; 95% CrI: 0.05-0.2 for R0 = 2.5), suggesting that 80% of secondary transmissions may have been caused by a small fraction of infectious individuals (~10%). A joint estimation yielded likely ranges for R 0 and k (95% CrIs: R 0 1.4-12; k 0.04-0.2); however, the upper bound of R 0 was not well informed by the model and data, which did not notably differ from that of the prior distribution. Conclusions: Our finding of a highly-overdispersed offspring distribution highlights a potential benefit to focusing intervention efforts on superspreading. As most infected individuals do not contribute to the expansion of an epidemic, the effective reproduction number could be drastically reduced by preventing relatively rare superspreading events.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Results If no non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) were applied, there could have been a cumulative number of 51,800,000 (95% UI: 19,100,000\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015377,600,000) COVID-19 infections and 266,000 (95% UI: 119,000\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153476,000) deaths by September 21 2020. If physical distancing interventions, such as school/border closures and self-isolation interventions, had been introduced a week earlier than they were actually launched, a 30% reduction in the number of infections and deaths could have been achieved by September 21 2020. The observed daily number of deaths showed that the R c was one or more than one almost every day during the analysis period. Conclusions Our models suggest that the NPIs implemented in Iran between 21 January and 21 September 2020 had significant effects on the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Therefore, we recommend that these interventions are considered when designing future control programs, while simultaneously considering innovative approaches that can minimize harmful economic impacts on the community and the state. Our study also showed that the timely implementation of NPIs showed a profound effect on further reductions in the numbers of infections and deaths. This highlights the importance of forecasting and early detection of future waves of infection and of the need for effective preparedness and response capabilities.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The driving factors for the spread of COVID-19 and their quantitative contributions, especially to rebound waves, are not well studied. Multidimensional time-series data, including policy, travel, medical, socioeconomic, environmental, mutant and vaccine related data, were collected from 39 countries up to June 30, 2021, and an interpretable machine learning framework (XGBoost model with Shapley Additive explanation interpretation) was used to systematically analyze the effect of multiple factors on the spread of COVID-19, using the daily effective reproduction number as an indicator. Based on a model of the pre-vaccine era, policy-related factors were shown to be the main drivers of the spread of COVID-19, with a contribution of 60.81%. In the post-vaccine era, the contribution of policy-related factors decreased to 28.34%, accompanied with an increase in the contribution of travel-related factors, such as domestic flights, and contributions emerged for mutant-related (16.49%) and vaccine-related (7.06%) factors. For single-peak countries, the dominant ones were policy-related factors during both the rising and fading stages, with overall contributions of 33.7% and 37.7%, respectively. For double-peak countries, factors from the rebound stage contributed 45.8% and policy-related factors showed the greatest contribution in both the rebound (32.6%) and fading (25.0%) stages. For multiple-peak countries, the Delta variant, domestic flights (current month) and the daily vaccination population are the three greatest contributors (8.12%, 7.59% and 7.26%, respectively). Forecasting models to predict the rebound risk were built based on these findings, with accuracies of 0.78 and 0.81 for the pre- and post-vaccine eras, respectively. These findings quantitatively demonstrate the systematic drivers of the spread of COVID-19, and the framework proposed in this study will facilitate the targeted prevention and control of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.

In absence of any effective therapeutics or drugs and with an unknown epidemiological life cycle, predictive mathematical models can aid in understanding of both coronavirus disease control and management. In this study, we propose a compartmental mathematical model to predict and control the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic in India with epidemic data up to April 30, 2020. We compute the basic reproduction number R 0, which will be used further to study the model simulations and predictions. We perform local and global stability analysis for the infection free equilibrium point E 0as well as an endemic equilibrium point E* with respect to the basic reproduction number R 0. Moreover, we showed the criteria of disease persistence for R 0&gt; 1. We conduct a sensitivity analysis in our coronavirus model to determine the relative importance of model parameters to disease transmission. We compute the sensitivity indices of the reproduction number R 0(which quantifies initial disease transmission) to the estimated parameter values. For the estimated model parameters, we obtained R 0=1.6632, which shows the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in India. Our model simulation demonstrates that the disease transmission rate \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 sis more effective to mitigate the basic reproduction number R 0.

Because medical treatments for the virus are still emerging and a vaccine is not yet available, state and local governments have sought to limit its spread by enacting various social distancing interventions such as school closures and lockdown, but the effectiveness of these interventions is unknown. We applied an established, semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 spread in Europe to the United States. We estimated the effect of interventions across all states, contrasted the estimated reproduction number, Rt , for each state before and after lockdown, and contrasted predicted future fatalities with actual fatalities as a check on the model's validity. Overall, school closures and lockdown are the only interventions modeled that have a reliable impact on Rt , and lockdown appears to have played a key role in reducing Rt below 1.0. We conclude that reversal of lockdown, without implementation of additional, equally effective interventions, will enable continued, sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the United States.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We consider repeat SARS-CoV-2 testing models for the purpose of containing outbreaks in the residential campus community. The goal of repeat testing is to rapidly detect and isolate new infections as they occur to block transmission that would otherwise occur on campus and, of arguably greater importance, off. The models allow for the evolution of test sensitivity with time from infection, scheduled on-campus resident screening at a given frequency, imported infections from off campus throughout the school year, and a lag from testing until student isolation due to laboratory turnaround and student relocation delay. For early- (late-) transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by age of infection, we find that weekly screening cannot reliably contain outbreaks with reproductive numbers above 1.4 (1.6) if more than one imported exposure per 10,000 students occurs daily. Screening every three days can contain outbreaks providing the reproductive number remains below 1.75 (2.3) if transmission happens earlier (later) with time from infection, but at the cost of greatly increased false positive rates requiring more isolation quarters for students testing positive. Testing frequently while minimizing the delay from testing until isolation for those found positive are the most controllable levers for preventing large residential college outbreaks.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We also estimated the peak time of infections, the epidemic duration and the final size, which are basically consistent with real observation. We indicated by simulation that the traced high-risk contacts from incubated to susceptible decrease under NPIs, regardless of infected cases. The sensitivity analysis showed that reducing the exposure of the susceptible and increasing the clustering coefficient bolster COVID-19 control. With the enforcement of household quarantine, the reproduction number R and the epidemic prevalence declined effectively. Furthermore, we obtained the resumption time of work and production in China (except Hubei) on 10th March and in Hubei at the end of April 2020, respectively, which is broadly in line with the actual time.

Natural selection selects variants with higher effective reproduction numbers, increasing the overall transmissibility of the circulating viruses. In order to establish effective control measures for a new variant, it is crucial to know its transmissibility and replacement time course in early phases of the variant replacement. In this paper, we conduct retrospective prediction tests of the variant replacement from Alpha to Delta in England. Our method firstly estimated the relative reproduction number, the ratio of the reproduction number of a variant to that of another, from partial observations up to a given time point. Secondly, the replacement time course after the time point was predicted based on the estimates of relative reproduction number. Thirdly, the estimated relative reproduction number and the predicted time course were evaluated by being compared to those estimated using the entire observations. We found that it is possible to estimate the relative reproduction number of Delta with respect to Alpha when the frequency of Delta was more than or equal to 0.25. Using these relative reproduction numbers, predictions targeting on 1st June 2021, the date when the frequency of Delta reached 0.90, had maximum absolute prediction errors of 0.015 for frequencies of Delta and 0.067 for the average relative reproduction number of circulating viruses with respect to Alpha.

A set of communities can be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact within each community far exceeds that between them (e.g. the U.S. could be partitioned by state or commuting zone boundaries). COVID-19 can be eliminated if the community-to-community reproductive number---i.e. the expected/average number of other communities to which a single infected community will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. We find that this community-to-community reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between communities and exponential in the length of the time-delay before community-level action is taken. Thus, reductions in travel and the speed at which communities take action can play decisive roles in stopping the outbreak. The analysis suggests that for the coronavirus to be eliminated, it is not necessary to impose aggressive social distancing measures all over the world at once, but rather only in communities in which active spreading is detected. The sooner such measures are imposed, the shorter the duration they must remain in place. If infected communities (including those that become re-infected in the future) are quick enough to act, the number of actively infected communities (and thus the number of communities in which such measures are required) will exponentially decrease over time.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Effective use of such programs requires methods to estimate their current and anticipated impact. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We present a mathematical modeling framework to evaluate the expected reductions in the reproductive number, R, from test-trace-isolate programs. This framework is implemented in a publicly available R package and an online application. We evaluated the effects of completeness in case detection and contact tracing and speed of isolation and quarantine using parameters consistent with COVID-19 transmission (R0: 2.5, generation time: 6.5 days). We show that R is most sensitive to changes in the proportion of cases detected in almost all scenarios, and other metrics have a reduced impact when case detection levels are low (<30%). Although test-trace-isolate programs can contribute substantially to reducing R, exceptional performance across all metrics is needed to bring R below one through test-trace-isolate alone, highlighting the need for comprehensive control strategies. Results from this model also indicate that metrics used to evaluate performance of test-trace-isolate, such as the proportion of identified infections among traced contacts, may be misleading. While estimates of the impact of test-trace-isolate are sensitive to assumptions about COVID-19 natural history and adherence to isolation and quarantine, our qualitative findings are robust across numerous sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Effective test-trace-isolate programs first need to be strong in the \"test\" component, as case detection underlies all other program activities. Even moderately effective test-trace-isolate programs are an important tool for controlling the COVID-19 pandemic and can alleviate the need for more restrictive social distancing measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Trend of the basic reproduction number (R0), which reached a maximum of 1.39 at the peak of the epidemic and declined to 0.92 towards the end, shows that until added hospital controls are introduced, the outbreak would continue with sustained transmission between wards.

In addition to the interventions mentioned above, high-risk individuals must take extra precaution measures, including telework, avoiding social gathering or public places, etc. to reduce the transmission.

In view of this scenario, this research aims to explore the effectiveness of population mobility restriction in alleviating epidemic transmission during different stages of the outbreak. Taking Shenzhen, a city with a large immigrant population in China, as a case study, the real-time reproduction number of COVID-19 is estimated by statistical methods to represent the dynamic spatiotemporal transmission pattern of COVID-19. Furthermore, migration data between Shenzhen and other provinces are collected to investigate the impact of nationwide population flow on near-real-time dynamic reproductive numbers. The results show that traffic flow control between populated cities has an inhibitory effect on urban transmission, but this effect is not significant in the late stage of the epidemic spread in China. This finding implies that the government should limit international and domestic population movement starting from the very early stage of the outbreak. This work confirms the effectiveness of travel restriction measures in the face of COVID-19 in China and provides new insight for densely populated cities in imposing intervention measures at various stages of the transmission cycle.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We studied the variation in transmission of COVID-19, locally in Wuhan, as well as on a larger spatial scale, among different cities and even among provinces in mainland China. Methods: In addition to reported numbers of new cases, we have been able to assemble detailed contact data for some of the initial clusters of COVID-19. This enabled estimation of the serial interval for clinical cases, as well as reproduction numbers for small and large regions. Findings: We estimated the average serial interval was 4.8 days. For early transmission in Wuhan, any infectious case produced as many as four new cases, transmission outside Wuhan was less intense, with reproduction numbers below two. During the rapid growth phase of the outbreak the region of Wuhan city acted as a hot spot, generating new cases upon contact, while locally, in other provinces, transmission was low. Interpretation: COVID-19 is capable of spreading very rapidly. The sizes of outbreak in provinces of mainland China mainly depended on the numbers of cases imported from Wuhan as the local reproduction numbers were low. The COVID-19 epidemic should be controllable with appropriate interventions (suspension of public transportation, cancellation of mass gatherings, implementation of surveillance and testing, and promotion of personal hygiene and face mask use).\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The first case in India was reported on 30th January 2020, with the cases crossing 4 million on the day paper was written. This pandemic has caused more than 80,000 fatalities with 3 million recoveries. Strict lockdown of the nation for two months, immediate isolation of infected cases and app-based tracing of infected are some of the proactive steps taken by the authorities. For a better understanding of the evolution of COVID-19 in the world, study on evolution and growth of cases in India could not be avoided. To understand the same, one of the compartment model: Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) is used. Recovery rate and doubling rate of the total reported positive cases in the country had crossed 75% and 25 days, respectively. It is also estimated that there is a strong positive correlation between testing rate and detection of new cases up to 6 million tests per day. Using the SIQR modelling effective reproduction number, epidemic doubling rate and infected to quarantined ratio is determined to check the temporal evolution of the pandemic in the country. Effective reproduction number that was at its peak during first half of the April is gradually converging to 1. It is also estimated using this model that with each detected cases in India, there could be 10-50 undetected cases. Like every mathematical model, this model also has some assumptions. To make this model more robust, a technique with weighted parameter that can avoid a person with a strong immune system to be equally vulnerable to the infection, can be worked out. Machine learning algorithms can also be used to train our model with the data of other countries to make the analysis and prediction more precise and accurate.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Estimating the transmissibility, which is usually characterized by the basic reproductive number R(0), the mean number of secondary infectious cases generated by a single primary infectious case introduced into a totally susceptible population, provides crucial information for the effort required to stop infection spreading. Hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted indirectly through contaminated food and environment. An outbreak from March to June 2011 was reported to have occurred at an elementary school of 698 pupils in China and it was found that the outbreak was due to direct transmission between school children. Based on the symptom onset date and the social contact network of the children, in this study we estimate the serial interval (i.e. the gap in symptom onset between an infectee and its infector) and use different statistical methods to estimate R(0). Combining with the positivity of IgG antibodies tests, we develop a compartmental transmission dynamics model which includes both asymptomatic and symptomatic infections to estimate the overall R(0). Our analysis suggests a serial interval of mean = 23.9 days and standard deviation = 20.9 days. The different statistical methods suggest estimates for R(0) in the outbreak varying from 2.1 to 2.8, and the estimates from the transmission dynamics model are consistent with this range. Our estimates are in agreement with that from one study in England but are higher than that from one study in the United States. Our transmission dynamics model suggests that the proportion of symptomatic infections is about 9%, implying that there were about 344 asymptomatic infections along with the 32 observed symptomatic cases. Furthermore, it is shown that the inclusion of asymptomatic infection in the epidemic process increases the estimate of R(0) but does not do so greatly provided that the proportion of symptomatic infections is constant over the outbreak and there is no difference in transmissibility between symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, multiple recent findings have verified its importance in blocking virus spread. Evidence on the association between mobility, cases imported from abroad and local medical resource supplies is limited. To reveal the association, this study quantified the importance of inter- and intra-country mobility in containing virus spread and avoiding hospitalizations during early stages of COVID-19 outbreaks in India, Japan, and China. We calculated the time-varying reproductive number (Rt) and duration from illness onset to diagnosis confirmation (Doc), to represent conditions of virus spread and hospital bed shortages, respectively. Results showed that inter-country mobility fluctuation could explain 80%, 35%, and 12% of the variance in imported cases and could prevent 20 million, 5 million, and 40 million imported cases in India, Japan and China, respectively. The critical time for screening and monitoring of imported cases is 2 weeks at minimum and 4 weeks at maximum, according to the time when the Pearson's Rs between Rt and imported cases reaches a peak (>0.8). We also found that if local transmission is initiated, a 1% increase in intra-country mobility would result in 1430 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1501), 109 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1181), and 10 (\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b11) additional bed shortages, as estimated using the Doc in India, Japan, and China, respectively.

We present a method to rigorously study the effectiveness of interventions on the rate of the time-varying reproduction number Rt and on human mobility, considered here as a proxy measure of policy adherence and social distancing. We frame our model using a causal inference approach to quantify the impact of five governmental interventions introduced until June 2020 to control the outbreak in 113 countries: confinement, school closure, mask wearing, cultural closure, and work restrictions. Our results indicate that mobility changes are more accurately predicted when compared to reproduction number. All NPIs, except for mask wearing, significantly affected human mobility trends. From these, schools and cultural closure mandates showed the largest effect on social distancing. We also found that closing schools, issuing face mask usage, and work-from-home mandates also caused a persistent reduction on Rt after their initiation, which was not observed with the other social distancing measures.

This paper deals with artificial intelligence (AI) methods that can address the problem of predicting scale, dynamics and sensitivity of the outbreak to preventive actions undertaken with a view to combatting the epidemic. In our study, we developed a cellular automata (CA) model for simulating the COVID-19 disease spreading. The enhanced infectious disease dynamics [Formula: see text] (Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, and Recovered) model was applied to estimate the epidemic trends in Poland, France, and Spain. We introduced new parameters into the simulation framework which reflect the statistically confirmed dependencies such as age-dependent death probability, a different definition of the contact rate and enhanced parameters reflecting population mobility. To estimate key epidemiological measures and to predict possible dynamics of the disease, we juxtaposed crucial CA framework parameters to the reported COVID-19 values, e.g. length of infection, mortality rates and the reproduction number. Moreover, we used real population density and age structures of the studied epidemic populations. The model presented allows for the examination of the effectiveness of preventive actions and their impact on the spreading rate and the duration of the disease. It also shows the influence of structure and behavior of the populations studied on key epidemic parameters, such as mortality and infection rates. Although our results are critically dependent on the assumptions underpinning our model and there is considerable uncertainty associated with the outbreaks at such an early epidemic stage, the obtained simulation results seem to be in general agreement with the observed behavior of the real COVID-19 disease, and our numerical framework can be effectively used to analyze the dynamics and efficacy of epidemic containment methods.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Eventually, such characteristics are also observed between different regions of the same country. Herewith, we study the heterogeneous spreading of the confirmed infected cases and deaths by the COVID-19 until May 30th, 2020, in the Brazilian territory, which has been seen as the current epicenter of the pandemic in South America. Our first set of results is related to the similarities and it shows that: (i) a power-law growth of the cumulative number of infected people is observed for federative units of the five regions of Brazil; and (ii) the Distance Correlation (DC) calculated between the time series of the most affected federative units and the curve that describes the evolution of the pandemic in Brazil remains about 1 in most of the time, while such quantity calculated for the federative units with a low incidence of newly infected people remains about 0.95. In the second set of results, we focus on the heterogeneous distribution of the confirmed cases and deaths, which is demonstrated by the fact that only three regions concentrate 92% of the cases. By applying the epidemiological SIRD model we estimated the effective reproduction number Re during the pandemic evolution and found that: (i) the mean value of Re for the eight most affected federative units in Brazil is about 2; (ii) the current value of Re for Brazil is greater than 1, which indicates that the epidemic peak is far; and (iii) Ceara was the only federative unit for which the current Re < 1. Based on these findings, we projected the effects of increase or decrease the effective reproduction number and concluded that if the value of Re increases 20%, not only the peak might grow at least 40% but also its occurrence might be anticipated, which hastens the collapse of the public health care system. In all cases, to keep the effective reproduction number 20% below the current one can save thousands of people in the long term.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The model is fitted to data from the Ontario (Toronto) in Canada, Hong Kong in China and Singapore outbreaks and predictions are made based on various assumptions and observations, including the current effect of isolating individuals diagnosed with SARS. The epidemic dynamics for Hong Kong and Singapore appear to be different from the dynamics in Toronto, Ontario. Toronto shows a very rapid increase in the number of cases between March 31st and April 6th, followed by a {\\it significant} slowing in the number of new cases. We explain this as the result of an increase in the diagnostic rate and in the effectiveness of patient isolation after March 26th. Our best estimates are consistent with SARS eventually being contained in Toronto, although the time of containment is sensitive to the parameters in our model. It is shown that despite the empirically modeled heterogeneity in transmission, SARS' average reproductive number is 1.2, a value quite similar to that computed for some strains of influenza \\cite{CC2}. Although it would not be surprising to see levels of SARS infection higher than ten per cent in some regions of the world (if unchecked), lack of data and the observed heterogeneity and sensitivity of parameters prevent us from predicting the long-term impact of SARS.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The most affected European countries are, so far, Italy and Spain. In both countries (and others), the authorities decreed a lockdown, with local specificities. The objective of this work is to evaluate the impact of the measures undertaken in Spain to deal with the pandemic. Method: We estimated the number of cases and the impact of lockdown on the reproducibility number based on the hospitalization reports up to April 15th 2020. Results: The estimated number of cases shows a sharp increase until the lockdown, followed by a slowing down and then a decrease after full quarantine was implemented. Differences in the basic reproduction ratio are also significant, dropping from de 5.89 (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 5.46-7.09) before the lockdown to 0.48 (95%CI: 0.15-1.17) afterwards. Conclusions: Handling a pandemic like COVID-19 is complex and requires quick decision making. The large differences found in the speed of propagation of the disease show us that being able to implement interventions at the earliest stage is crucial to minimise the impact of a potential infectious threat. Our work also stresses the importance of reliable up to date epidemiological data in order to accurately assess the impact of Public Health policies on viral outbreak.

It caused an extensive health and economic burden around the globe. There is no proven effective treatment yet, except certain preventive mechanisms. Some studies assessing the effects of different preventive strategies have been published. However, there is no conclusive evidence. Therefore, this study aimed to review evidences related to COVID-19 prevention strategies achieved through contact tracing, screening, quarantine, and isolation to determine best practices. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines by searching articles from major medical databases such as PubMed/Medline, Global Health Database, Embase, CINAHL, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries. Non-randomized and modeling articles published to date in areas of COVID prevention with contact tracing, screening, quarantine, and isolation were included. Two experts screened the articles and assessed risk of bias with ROBINS-I tool and certainty of evidence with GRADE approach. The findings were presented narratively and in tabular form. RESULTS: We included 22 (9 observational and 13 modeling) studies. The studies consistently reported the benefit of quarantine, contact tracing, screening, and isolation in different settings. Model estimates indicated that quarantine of exposed people averted 44 to 81% of incident cases and 31 to 63% of deaths. Quarantine along with others can also halve the reproductive number and reduce the incidence, thus, shortening the epidemic period effectively. Early initiation of quarantine, operating large-scale screenings, strong contact tracing systems, and isolation of cases can effectively reduce the epidemic. However, adhering only to screening and isolation with lower coverage can miss more than 75% of asymptomatic cases; hence, it is not effective. CONCLUSION: Quarantine, contact tracing, screening, and isolation are effective measures of COVID-19 prevention, particularly when integrated together. In order to be more effective, quarantine should be implemented early and should cover a larger community.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We studied the changes in R0 on DP from January 21 to February 19, 2020 based on chain binomial models under two scenarios: no quarantine assuming a random mixing condition, and quarantine of passengers in cabins-passengers may get infected either by an infectious case in a shared cabin or by pre/asymptomatic crew who continued to work. Estimates of R0 at the beginning of the epidemic were 3.27 (95% CI, 3.02-3.54) and 3.78 (95% CI, 3.49-4.09) respectively for serial intervals of 5 and 6 days; and when quarantine started, with the reported asymptomatic ratio 0.505, R0 rose to 4.18 (95%CI, 3.86-4.52) and 4.73 (95%CI, 4.37-5.12) respectively for passengers who might be exposed to the virus due to pre/asymptomatic crew.

For any TTI strategy, however, mitigation is challenged by pre- and asymptomatic transmission, TTI-avoiders, and undetected spreaders, who strongly contribute to hidden infection chains. Here, we studied a semi-analytical model and identified two tipping points between controlled and uncontrolled spread: (1) the behavior-driven reproduction number of the hidden chains becomes too large to be compensated by the TTI capabilities, and (2) the number of new infections exceeds the tracing capacity. Both trigger a self-accelerating spread. We investigated how these tipping points depend on challenges like limited cooperation, missing contacts, and imperfect isolation. Our model results suggest that TTI alone is insufficient to contain an otherwise unhindered spread of SARS-CoV-2, implying that complementary measures like social distancing and improved hygiene remain necessary.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

With such epidemic characteristics and potential economic impact, HFMD is a significant public health issue in Thailand. Generally, contagious/infectious diseases' transmission dynamics vary across geolocations due to different socioeconomic situations, demography, and lifestyles. Hence, a nationwide comprehensive model of the disease's epidemic dynamics can provide information to understand better and predict a potential outbreak of this disease and efficiently and effectively manage its impact. However, there is no nationwide and comprehensive (i.e., the inclusion of reinfections in the model) model of HFDM dynamics for Thailand. This paper has endeavoured to promote nationwide comprehensive modelling of HFMD's epidemic dynamics and comprehend the reinfection cases. We have formulated the SEIRS epidemiological model with dynamic vitals, including reinfections, to explore this disease's prevalence. We also introduced periodic seasonality to reproduce the seasonal effect. The pattern of spread of this disease is uneven across the provinces in Thailand, so we used K-means clustering algorithm to cluster those provinces into three groups (i.e., highly, moderately, and least affected levels). We also analysed health records collected from district hospitals, which suggest significant reinfection cases. For example, we found that 11% (approximately) of infectious patients return for repeat treatment within the study period. We also performed sensitivity analysis which indicates that the basic reproduction number (R(0)) is sensitive to the rate of transmission (\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2) and the rate at which infected people recover (\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b3). By fitting the model with HFMD confirmed data for the provinces in each cluster, the basic reproduction number (R(0)) was estimated to be 2.643, 1.91, and 3.246 which are greater than 1. Based on this high R(0), this study recommends that this disease will persist in the coming years under identical cultural and environmental conditions.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The pandemic needs an enhanced mathematical model, therefore, we propose a SEIAJR compartmental mathematical model to estimate the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and the transmission dynamics of four European countries (Germany, United Kingdom, Switzerland and Spain). The proposed mathematical model incorporates mitigation and healthcare measures as recommended by ECDC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control). The simulation of proposed model is done in two phases. First-phase simulation estimates basic reproduction number and mitigation rate according to active infected cases in all four European countries. R 0 estimate 2.82 - 3.3 for considered European countries. Second-phase simulation predicts the dynamics of infection on the estimated R 0 with varying mitigation rate and constant healthcare rate. This study predicts that no more mitigation is required to invade the infection. The current mitigation and healthcare measures are enough to stop the propogation of infection, however, infection would last by end of July 2020.

To evaluate the effectiveness of transmission prevention strategies, infectivity modeling can be used to interpret and analyze various virus responses. In this study, compartmental modeling approaches are used to model and quantify the success of various control techniques, such as social behaviors. Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), a province in Canada, is a relatively isolated and easily-monitored region that can be used to study the characterization and effectiveness of infectivity model coefficients. The province has few points of entry and a lower contact frequency than densely populated urban districts. Based on the results, the implications of social distancing removed an estimated 85% of the susceptible population from potential exposure to a viral transmission. The modeling also determined a basic COVID-19 reproductive number of 3.7 in NL, higher than the globalized average of 2.3. Compartmental models are used to determine the validity of alternative pandemic responses, such as nonvaccine social practices to fight the wave of infection. The overall impact of COVID-19 in NL is concluded to have been effectively controlled by the implementation of social distancing behaviors, allowing for accurate quantification of modeling parameters.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

If such a strain emerges, and is not controlled at source [2,3], a pandemic is likely to result. Health policy in most countries will then be focused on reducing morbidity and mortality. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimate the expected reduction in primary attack rates for different household-based interventions using a mathematical model of influenza transmission within and between households. We show that, for lower transmissibility strains [2,4], the combination of household-based quarantine, isolation of cases outside the household, and targeted prophylactic use of anti-virals will be highly effective and likely feasible across a range of plausible transmission scenarios. For example, for a basic reproductive number (the average number of people infected by a typically infectious individual in an otherwise susceptible population) of 1.8, assuming only 50% compliance, this combination could reduce the infection (symptomatic) attack rate from 74% (49%) to 40% (27%), requiring peak quarantine and isolation levels of 6.2% and 0.8% of the population, respectively, and an overall anti-viral stockpile of 3.9 doses per member of the population. Although contact tracing may be additionally effective, the resources required make it impractical in most scenarios. CONCLUSIONS: National influenza pandemic preparedness plans currently focus on reducing the impact associated with a constant attack rate, rather than on reducing transmission. Our findings suggest that the additional benefits and resource requirements of household-based interventions in reducing average levels of transmission should also be considered, even when expected levels of compliance are only moderate.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We study the effect of noise intensity on the distribution and later derive and analyze the effect of changes in the transmission and recovery rates of the disease.

Since then, several countries went into lockdown. We estimate the effect of the lockdown in France on the contact rate and the effective reproduction number Re of the COVID-19. We obtain a reduction by a factor 7 (Re=0.47, 95%-CI: 0.45-0.50), compared to the estimates carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic. We also estimate the fraction of the population that would be infected by the beginning of May, at the official date at which the lockdown should be relaxed. We find a fraction of 3.7% (95%-CI: 3.0-4.8%) of the total French population, without taking into account the number of recovered individuals before April 1st, which is not known. This proportion is seemingly too low to reach herd immunity. Thus, even if the lockdown strongly mitigated the first epidemic wave, keeping a low value of Re is crucial to avoid an uncontrolled second wave (initiated with much more infectious cases than the first wave) and to hence avoid the saturation of hospital facilities. Our approach is based on the mechanistic-statistical formalism, which uses a probabilistic model to connect the data collection process and the latent epidemiological process, which is described by a SIR-type differential equation model.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In order to curb the SARS-Cov-2 prevalence, the Chinese government enacted a series of containment strategies including household quarantine, traffic restriction, city lockdowns etc. Indeed, the pandemic has been effectively mitigated, but the global transmission is not still optimistic. Evaluating such control measures in detail plays an important role in limiting SARS-Cov-2 spread for public health decision and policymakers. In this paper, based on the cumulative numbers of confirmed cases and deaths of SARS-Cov-2 infection, from January 31st to March 31st, announced by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, we established a mean-field model, considering the substantial contact change under some restrictive measures, to study the dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 infection in mainland China. By the Metropolis-Hastings (M-H) algorithm of Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method, our model provided a good fitting to the overall trends of SARS-Cov-2 infections and discovers the transmission heterogeneities by some extreme containment strategies to some extent. The basic reproduction number was approximated to be 2.05 (95% CI [1.35,2.87]); the hospitalized cases arrived at the peak of 29766 (95% CI [29743,29868]) on February 7th (95% CI [Feb.6th, Feb.8th]).

Here we estimate the basic reproductive number for COVID-19 and propose a dynamical model for the time course of infection number. With this model, we assessed the effects of different measures for infection risk control. The model is different from the previous ones as it models the population as heterogeneous, with subpopulations having different infection risks. Our analyses showed that after this heterogeneity is incorporated in the model, several characteristics of the epidemic are estimated more accurately: the total number of cases and peak number of cases are lower compared to the homogeneous case, the early-stage growth rate in the number of infection cases is little affected, and the decrease in the number of infections slows down during the epidemic late stage. The comparison of our model results with the available data for COVID-19 indicates that the anti-epidemic measures undertaken in China and the rest of the world managed to decrease the basic reproductive number but did not assure an accumulation of sufficient collective immunity. Thus, the epidemic has a high likelihood to restart, which necessitates a careful approach to lifting the quarantine measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

As a case study, we consider Rift Valley Fever Disease (RFVD) utilizing parameter estimations from prior studies. SA indicates that 1% increase in within-host pathogen growth rate can lead up to 8% increase in R0; up to 1% increase in steady-state infected host abundance, and up to 4% increase in infectiousness of hosts when the reproduction number R0 is larger than one.

We analyze the model and its submodels with single infections individually. We obtain the awareness-induced basic reproduction numbers and discuss the global stability of disease-free equilibrium when provision limitation is zero. We observe that the submodels exhibit forward as well as backward bifurcations under provision restriction. Further, we derive thresholds for resource limitations regulating the dynamical behavior of the systems while analyzing the stability of endemic equilibrium of the models with single infections. Sophisticated simulation approaches are implemented to discover the influences of provision-restricted medication and awareness on dual epidemic. Our findings convey the persistence of co-infection though the basic reproduction number is below unity, if the provision restriction remains uncurbed. An observable insight is that, in spite of having epidemic threshold less than unity and no limitation in TB treatment, co-infection relapses and persists in the population, when there is no awareness attempt. Numerical findings emphasize the urgent need of increased treatment accessibility and importance of awareness in the current situation.

Simulation is a cost- and time-effective way of predicting the evolution of the infection as the joint influence of many different factors: interaction patterns, personal characteristics, travel patterns, meteorological conditions, previous vaccination, etc. The work presented in this paper extends EpiGraph, our influenza epidemic simulator, by introducing a meteorological model as a modular component that interacts with the rest of EpiGraph\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s modules to refine our previous simulation results. Our goal is to estimate the effects of changes in temperature and relative humidity on the patterns of epidemic influenza based on data provided by the Spanish Influenza Sentinel Surveillance System (SISSS) and the Spanish Meteorological Agency (AEMET). METHODS: Our meteorological model is based on the regression model developed by AB and JS, and it is tuned with influenza surveillance data obtained from SISSS. After pre-processing this data to clean it and reconstruct missing samples, we obtain new values for the reproduction number of each urban region in Spain, every 10 minutes during 2011. We simulate the propagation of the influenza by setting the date of the epidemic onset and the initial influenza-illness rates for each urban region. RESULTS: We show that the simulation results have the same propagation shape as the weekly influenza rates as recorded by SISSS. We perform experiments for a realistic scenario based on actual meteorological data from 2010-2011, and for synthetic values assumed under simplified predicted climate change conditions.

To investigate the interaction of disease transmission and information dissemination dynamics, we proposed a multi-scale model which explicitly models both the disease transmission with saturated recovery rate and information transmission to evaluate the effect of information transmission on dynamic behaviors. Considering time variation between information dissemination, epidemiological and demographic processes, we obtained a slow-fast system by reasonably introducing a sufficiently small quantity. We carefully examined the dynamics of proposed system, including existence and stability of possible equilibria and existence of backward bifurcation, by using the fast-slow theory and directly investigating the full system. We then compared the dynamics of the proposed system and the essential thresholds based on two methods, and obtained the similarity between the basic dynamical behaviors of the slow system and that of the full system. Finally, we parameterized the proposed model on the basis of the COVID-19 case data in mainland China and data related to news items, and estimated the basic reproduction number to be 3.25. Numerical analysis suggested that information transmission about COVID-19 pandemic caused by media coverage can reduce the peak size, which mitigates the transmission dynamics during the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Due to the absence of specific antivirals or vaccine, mathematical modeling plays an important role in better understanding the disease dynamics and in designing strategies to control the rapidly spreading infectious disease. In our study, we developed a new compartmental model that explains the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We calibrated our proposed model with daily COVID-19 data for four Indian states, namely, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh. We study the qualitative properties of the model, including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to the basic reproduction number R0. The disease-free equilibrium becomes stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate of infected individuals increases, but if the disease transmission rate remains higher, then the endemic equilibrium always remains stable. For the estimated model parameters, R0>1 for all four states, which suggests the significant outbreak of COVID-19. Short-time prediction shows the increasing trend of daily and cumulative cases of COVID-19 for the four states of India.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

To the date more than 13 million confirmed cases and more than half a million are dead around the world. This virus also attached Malaysia in its immature stage where 8718 cases were confirmed and 122 were declared as death. Malaysia responsibly controlled the spread by enforcing MCO. Hence, it is required to visualize the pattern of Covid-19 spread. Also, it is necessary to estimate the impact of the enforced prevention measures. In this paper, an infectious disease dynamic modeling (SEIR) is used to estimate the epidemic spread in Malaysia. The main assumption is to update the reproduction number Rt with respect to the implemented prevention measures. For a time-frame of five month, the Rt was assumed to vary between 2.9 and 0.3. Moreover, the manuscript includes two possible scenarios: the first will be the extension of the stricter measures all over the country, and the second will be the gradual lift of the lock-down. After implementing several stages of lock-down we have found that the estimated values of the Rt with respect to the strictness degree varies between 0.2 to 1.1. A continuous strict lock-down may reduce the Rt to 0.2 and accordingly the estimated active cases will be reduced to 20 by the beginning of September 2020. In contrast, the second scenario considers a gradual lift of the enforced prevention measures by the end of June 2020, here we have considered three possible outcomes according to the MCO relaxation. Thus, the estimated values of Rt = 0.7, 0.9, 1.1, which shows a rapid increase in the number of active cases. The implemented SEIR model shows a close resemblance with the actual data recorded from 10, March till 7, July 2020.

We hypothesize that this targeted training will enhance the research environment at MSI's, increase the diversity of NIH-funded investigators and improve the training of underrepresented students in biomedical research, thus providing a feed-forward mechanism to expand the diversity of the US biomedical workforce in future years. A hallmark of IMERS is to engage participants in hands-on, active-learning style grant-writing training for faculty who are poised to submit NIH proposals ranging from development/exploratory to R01s. This training is provided by UK faculty and experienced research development professionals. The IMERS model incorporates guided writing, participatory training, and active learning. Training is comprised of several modalities. First, IMERS offers two 3-day grant-writing retreats/year on the UK campus. These workshops are designed for highly motivated investigators who have submitted proposals to NIH without success and those who have been actively planning NIH submission;~25 faculty are selected for each workshop via an on-line application. On-site workshops include consultation with actively funded UK investigators and staff from the UK Proposal Development Office;we strive to maintain post-workshop interactions between participants and UK faculty/staff. Three 2-day off-site workshops/year are also offered. The IMERS staff will work with off-site institutions to tailor the workshops to specific needs. In-person workshops have been postponed due to COVID-19 restrictions, but will resume when safe to do so. However, we have developed an active series of virtual workshops and seminars during this time, and we anticipate that these and additional on-line activities will continue as a third arm of training even after restriction are lifted. Travel and lodging expenses for faculty to attend UK workshops, for the IMERS team to travel, are covered by the grant. Workshop sessions cover numerous topics, including: using NIH resources for program/funding information, budget issues, the proposal review process, writing a high-impact specific aims page and an effective research strategy, rigor and reproducibility, responsible conduct of research, NIH Biosketch, navigating the NIH resubmission process, and mentoring student researchers. Program evaluation, based in part on participant survey data, communication email and an active ListServ and subsequent submission rate and success, validates that program participants have increased confidence in their grant-writing abilities and are succeeding in obtaining NIH funding.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We trained an artificial neural network model, a modified auto-encoder with Covid19 Chinese data, to forecast epidemic curve of the different Italian regions, and use the susceptible/exposed/infected/removed (SEIR) compartment model to predict the spreading and peaks. We have estimated the basic reproduction number (R0), which represents the average number of people that can be infected by a person who has already acquired the infection - both by fitting the exponential growth rate of the infection across a one month period, and also by using a day by day assessment, based on single observations. Results. The expected peak of SEIR model for new daily cases was at the end of March at national level. The peak of overall positive cases is expected by April 11th in Southern Italian Regions, a couple of days after that of Lombardy and Northern regions.

The epidemic trends in different countries vary considerably due to different policy-making and resources mobilization. We calculated basic reproduction number (R0) and the time-varying estimate of the effective reproductive number (Rt) of COVID-19 by using the maximum likelihood method and the sequential Bayesian method, respectively. European and North American countries possessed higher R0 and unsteady Rt fluctuations, whereas some heavily affected Asian countries showed relatively low R0 and declining Rt now. The numbers of patients in Africa and Latin America are still low, but the potential risk of huge outbreaks cannot be ignored. Three scenarios were then simulated, generating distinct outcomes by using SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious, and removed) model. First, evidence-based prompt responses yield lower transmission rate followed by decreasing Rt. Second, implementation of effective control policies at a relatively late stage, in spite of huge casualties at early phase, can still achieve containment and mitigation. Third, wisely taking advantage of the time-window for developing countries in Africa and Latin America to adopt adequate measures can save more people's life.

We evaluate whether these measures might be sufficient to control the epidemic by estimating their impact on the reproduction number (R0, the average number of secondary cases generated per case). METHODS: We asked a representative sample of UK adults about their contact patterns on the previous day. The questionnaire was conducted online via email recruitment and documents the age and location of contacts and a measure of their intimacy (whether physical contact was made or not). In addition, we asked about adherence to different physical distancing measures. The first surveys were sent on Tuesday, 24 March, 1 day after a \"lockdown\" was implemented across the UK. We compared measured contact patterns during the \"lockdown\" to patterns of social contact made during a non-epidemic period. By comparing these, we estimated the change in reproduction number as a consequence of the physical distancing measures imposed. We used a meta-analysis of published estimates to inform our estimates of the reproduction number before interventions were put in place. RESULTS: We found a 74% reduction in the average daily number of contacts observed per participant (from 10.8 to 2.8). This would be sufficient to reduce R0 from 2.6 prior to lockdown to 0.62 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.89) after the lockdown, based on all types of contact and 0.37 (95% CI = 0.22-0.53) for physical (skin to skin) contacts only. CONCLUSIONS: The physical distancing measures adopted by the UK public have substantially reduced contact levels and will likely lead to a substantial impact and a decline in cases in the coming weeks. However, this projected decline in incidence will not occur immediately as there are significant delays between infection, the onset of symptomatic disease, and hospitalisation, as well as further delays to these events being reported. Tracking behavioural change can give a more rapid assessment of the impact of physical distancing measures than routine epidemiological surveillance.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In the absence of efficient therapeutics or vaccines, control strategies are currently based on non-pharmaceutical interventions, comprising changes in population behavior and governmental interventions, among which the prohibition of mass gatherings, closure of non-essential establishments, quarantine and movement restrictions. In this work we analyzed the effects of 547 published governmental interventions, and population adherence thereof, on the dynamics of COVID-19 cases across all 27 Brazilian states, with emphasis on state capitals and remaining inland cities. A generalized SEIR model with a time-varying transmission rate (TR), that considers transmission by asymptomatic individuals, is presented. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were used to calibrate the model parameters using non-linear least squares methods. We analyze the changes on the TR and effective reproduction number as a function of both the extent of enforced measures across Brazilian states as well as population movement. The social mobility reduction index, a measure of population movement, together with the stringency index, adapted to incorporate the degree of restrictions imposed by governmental regulations, were used in conjunction to quantify and compare the effects of varying degrees of policy strictness across Brazilian states. Our results show that population adherence to social distance recommendations plays an important role for the effectiveness of interventions, and represents a major challenge to the control of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Methods: : To evaluate the effect of strategy selection between individuals and groups when pre-response action, we incorporate a comparmental epidemic model into a game theoretical framework and use this to fit the cumluative confirmed data of Sweden (Feb. 27 - Mar. 12) and South Korea (Feb. 4 - Mar. 3). Results: : The transmission rate ( \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 ) is estimated from the fitted model, and the reproduction numbers ( R0 ) of two countries, Sweden and South Korea are estimated by 6.93 and 3.71, respectively. The probability of infection ( \u00c3\u008f\u00e2\u20ac\u00a0 p ) of Sweden is about 12% higher than that of South Korea. As the probability of attack that an epidemic occurs ( \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b8 ) increases, individuals equilibrium gradually increased than group optimum. Conclusions: : When comparing prevention policies of Sweden and South Korea, it was confirmed that pre-response can be an appropriate preventive strategy against the transmission of infection. The selection of a strategy between individuals and groups can lead to the collapse of altruism that tends to select an action strategy for personal benefit, as the probability of the epidemic attack increases.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We wished to study the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in this closed population. METHODS: A basic susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed (SEIR) compartmental model was developed using the daily stepwise approach in Microsoft Excel. An advanced model using standard differential equations in Python software version 3.6 was used to estimate R0 based on model fit to actual data. RESULTS: Forty-eight SARS-CoV-2 infections were found among the 474 quarantined individuals. Out of these, 44 (92%) were asymptomatic. R0 for the overall duration was found to be 2.29 (95% CI: 1.84-2.78). Male gender and age &#8805; 60 years were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection (RR = 4.33, 95% CI: 2.07-9.05 and 5.32, 95% CI: 3.13-9.04, respectively). Isolation of infected individuals and stricter quarantine of remaining individuals reduced the R0 from 2.41 initially to 1.17 subsequently. CONCLUSION: R0 value was found comparable to the earlier studies indicating similar transmission dynamics among quarantined individuals in India. Universal testing and prompt isolation of infected individuals reduced the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Smaller group sizes should be preferred to large groups during facility-based quarantine in evacuation situations. The role of asymptomatic individuals appears to be strong in SARS-CoV-2 transmission within closed populations.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The model includes immunization of susceptible people (S), quarantine (Q) of exposed people (E), isolation (J) of infectious people (I), a recovered population (R), and variation in population size due to natural births and deaths and deaths of infected people. It is shown analytically that the model has a disease-free equilibrium state which always exists and an endemic equilibrium state which exists if and only if the disease-free state is unstable. A simple formula is obtained for a generalized reproduction number [Formula: see text] where, for any given initial population, [Formula: see text] means that the initial population is locally asymptotically stable and [Formula: see text] means that the initial population is unstable. As special cases, simple formulas are given for the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , a disease-free reproduction number [Formula: see text] , and an endemic reproduction number [Formula: see text]. Formulas are derived for the sensitivity indices for variations in model parameters of the disease-free reproduction number [Formula: see text] and for the infected populations in the endemic equilibrium state. A simple formula in terms of the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] is derived for the critical immunization level required to prevent the spread of disease in an initially disease-free population. Numerical simulations are carried out using the Matlab program for parameters corresponding to the outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing, Hong Kong, Canada and Singapore in 2002 and 2003. From the sensitivity analyses for these four regions, the parameters are identified that are the most important for preventing the spread of disease in a disease-free population or for reducing infection in an infected population. The results support the importance of isolating infectious individuals in an epidemic and in maintaining a critical level of immunity in a population to prevent a disease from occurring.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, estimating this value is particularly challenging owing to the characteristics of epidemic data, including non-reproducibility and incompleteness. METHODS: In this study, we propose mathematical models with different population structures; each of these models can produce data on the number of cases of the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 epidemic in South Korea. These structured models incorporating the heterogeneity of age and region are used to estimate the reproduction numbers at various terminal times. Subsequently, the age- and region-specific reproduction numbers are also computed to analyze the differences illustrated in the incidence data. RESULTS: Incorporation of the age-structure or region-structure allows for robust estimation of parameters, while the basic SIR model provides estimated values beyond the reasonable range with severe fluctuation. The estimated duration of infectious period using age-structured model is around 3.8 and the reproduction number was estimated to be 1.6. The estimated duration of infectious period using region-structured model is around 2.1 and the reproduction number was estimated to be 1.4. The estimated age- and region-specific reproduction numbers are consistent with cumulative incidence for corresponding groups. CONCLUSIONS: Numerical results reveal that the introduction of heterogeneity into the population to represent the general characteristics of dynamics is essential for the robust estimation of parameters.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

I use simulation by an agent-based model as well as the mathematics of multi-type branching-processes to illustrate how the SS epidemic differs from the more familiar uniform epidemic (e.g., caused by influenza). The conclusions may surprise the reader: (a) The SS epidemic must be described by at least two numbers, such as the mean reproductive number (of\"secondary\"cases caused by a\"primary case\"), R0, and the variance of same, call it V0; (b) Even if R0>1, if V0>>R0 the probability that an infection-chain caused by one primary case goes extinct without intervention may be close to one (e.g., 0.97); (c) The SS epidemic may have a long\"kindling period\"in which sporadic cases appear (transmitted from some unknown host) and generate a cluster of cases, but the chains peter out, perhaps generating a false sense of security that a pandemic will not occur; (d) Interventions such as isolation (or contact-tracing and secondary case isolation) may prove efficacious even without driving R0 below one; (e) The efficacy of such interventions diminishes, but slowly, with increasing V0 at fixed R0.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of county-level factors with variation in the SARS-CoV-2 reproduction number over time. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study included 211 counties, representing state capitals and cities with at least 100 000 residents and including 178 892 208 US residents, in 46 states and the District of Columbia between February 25, 2020, and April 23, 2020. EXPOSURES: Social distancing, measured by percentage change in visits to nonessential businesses; population density; and daily wet-bulb temperatures. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Instantaneous reproduction number (R(t)), or cases generated by each incident case at a given time, estimated from daily case incidence data. RESULTS: The 211 counties contained 178 892 208 of 326 289 971 US residents (54.8%). Median (interquartile range) population density was 1022.7 (471.2-1846.0) people per square mile. The mean (SD) peak reduction in visits to nonessential business between April 6 and April 19, as the country was sheltering in place, was 68.7% (7.9%). Median (interquartile range) daily wet-bulb temperatures were 7.5 (3.8-12.8) \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C. Median (interquartile range) case incidence and fatality rates per 100 000 people were approximately 10 times higher for the top decile of densely populated counties (1185.2 [313.2-1891.2] cases; 43.7 [10.4-106.7] deaths) than for counties in the lowest density quartile (121.4 [87.8-175.4] cases; 4.2 [1.9-8.0] deaths). Mean (SD) R(t) in the first 2 weeks was 5.7 (2.5) in the top decile compared with 3.1 (1.2) in the lowest quartile. In multivariable analysis, a 50% decrease in visits to nonessential businesses was associated with a 45% decrease in R(t) (95% CI, 43%-49%). From a relative R(t) at 0 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C of 2.13 (95% CI, 1.89-2.40), relative R(t) decreased to a minimum as temperatures warmed to 11 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C, increased between 11 and 20 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C (1.61; 95% CI, 1.42-1.84) and then declined again at temperatures greater than 20 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C.

Results 175,000 volunteers tested across England between 18th September and 5th October. Findings show a national prevalence of 0.60% (95% confidence interval 0.55%, 0.71%) and doubling of the virus every 29 (17, 84) days in England corresponding to an estimated national R of 1.16 (1.05, 1.27).

                "prompt": "Estimating epidemiologic dynamics from cross-sectional viral load distributions\nINTRODUCTION: Current approaches to epidemic monitoring rely on case counts, test positivity rates, and reported deaths or hospitalizations. These metrics, however, provide a limited and often biased picture as a result of testing constraints, unrepresentative sampling, and reporting delays. Random cross-sectional virologic surveys can overcome some of these biases by providing snapshots of infection prevalence but currently offer little information on the epidemic trajectory without sampling across multiple time points. RATIONALE: We develop a new method that uses information inherent in cycle threshold (Ct) values from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) tests to robustly estimate the epidemic trajectory from multiple or even a single cross section of positive samples. Ct values are related to viral loads, which depend on the time since infection; Ct values are generally lower when the time between infection and sample collection is short. Despite variation across individuals, samples, and testing platforms, Ct values provide a probabilistic measure of time since infection. We find that the distribution of Ct values across positive specimens at a single time point reflects the epidemic trajectory: A growing epidemic will necessarily have a high proportion of recently infected individuals with high viral loads, whereas a declining epidemic will have more individuals with older infections and thus lower viral loads. Because of these changing proportions, the epidemic trajectory or growth rate should be inferable from the distribution of Ct values collected in a single cross section, and multiple successive cross sections should enable identification of the longer-term incidence curve. Moreover, understanding the relationship between sample viral loads and epidemic dynamics provides additional insights into why viral loads from surveillance testing may appear higher for emerging viruses or variants and lower for out-breaks that are slowing, even absent changes in individual-level viral kinetics. RESULTS: Using a mathematical model for population-level viral load distributions calibrated to known features of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral load kinetics, we show that the median and skewness of Ct values in a random sample change over the course of an epidemic. By formalizing this relationship, we demonstrate that Ct values from a single random cross section of virologic testing can estimate the time-varying reproductive number of the virus in a population, which we validate using data collected from comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 testing in long-term care facilities. Using a more flexible approach to modeling infection incidence, we also develop a method that can reliably estimate the epidemic trajectory in even more-complex populations, where interventions may be implemented and relaxed over time. This method performed well in estimating the epidemic trajectory in the state of Massachusetts using routine hospital admissions RT-qPCR testing data\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009daccurately replicating estimates from other sources for the entire state. CONCLUSION: This work provides a new method for estimating the epidemic growth rate and a framework for robust epidemic monitoring using RT-qPCR Ct values that are often simply discarded. By deploying single or repeated (but small) random surveillance samples and making the best use of the semiquantitative testing data, we can estimate epidemic trajectories in real time and avoid biases arising from nonrandom samples or changes in testing practices over time. Understanding the relationship between population-level viral loads and the state of an epidemic reveals important implications and opportunities for interpreting virologic surveillance data. It also highlights the need for such surveillance, as these results show how to use it most informatively.

The above statistical analysis is able to shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak, and gives insight on what epidemiological stage a region is in.

The analysis at territorial level studies the changes in R0-the basic reproduction number-and median excess mortality, across territories with different levels of urbanization. The unique findings of this study encompassing most European Union Member States confirm and define the demographic and territorial differential impacts in terms of infections and fatalities during the first wave of the pandemic in 2020.

We address this important problem from a computational and machine learning perspective. More specifically, we want to statistically estimate all the relevant parameters for the new coronavirus COVID-19, such as the reproduction number, fatality rate or length of infectiousness period, based on Romanian patients, as well as be able to predict future outcomes. This endeavor is important, since it is well known that these factors vary across the globe, and might be dependent on many causes, including social, medical, age and genetic factors. We use a recently published improved version of SEIR, which is the classic, established model for infectious diseases. We want to infer all the parameters of the model, which govern the evolution of the pandemic in Romania, based on the only reliable, true measurement, which is the number of deaths. Once the model parameters are estimated, we are able to predict all the other relevant measures, such as the number of exposed and infectious people. To this end, we propose a self-supervised approach to train a deep convolutional network to guess the correct set of Modified-SEIR model parameters, given the observed number of daily fatalities. Then, we refine the solution with a stochastic coordinate descent approach. We compare our deep learning optimization scheme with the classic grid search approach and show great improvement in both computational time and prediction accuracy. We find an optimistic result in the case fatality rate for Romania which may be around 0.3% and we also demonstrate that our model is able to correctly predict the number of daily fatalities for up to three weeks in the future.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

There are numerous classical epidemiology models trying to quantify epidemiology metrics. To forecast epidemics, classical approaches usually need parameter estimations, such as the contagion rate or the basic reproduction number. Here, we propose a data-driven, parameter-free, geometric approach to access the emergence of a pandemic state by studying the Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci network curvatures. Discrete Ollivier-Ricci curvature has been used successfully to forecast risk in financial networks and we suggest that those results can provide analogous results for COVID-19 epidemic time-series. We first compute both curvatures in a toy-model of epidemic time-series with delays, which allows us to create epidemic networks. We also compared our results to classical network metrics. By doing so, we are able to verify that the Ollivier-Ricci and Forman-Ricci curvatures can be a parameter-free estimate for identifying a pandemic state in the simulated epidemic. On this basis, we then compute both Forman-Ricci and Ollivier-Ricci curvatures for real epidemic networks built from COVID-19 epidemic time-series available at the World Health Organization (WHO). This approach allows us to detect early warning signs of the emergence of the pandemic. The advantage of our method lies in providing an early geometrical data marker for the pandemic state, regardless of parameter estimation and stochastic modelling.

India's multipronged response included nonpharmacological interventions (NPIs) like intensive case-based surveillance, expanding testing capacity, social distancing, health promotion, and progressive travel restrictions leading to a complete halt of international and domestic movements (lockdown). Objectives: We studied the impact of NPI on transmission dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic in India and estimated the minimum level of herd immunity required to halt it. Methods: We plotted time distribution, estimated basic (R0) and time-dependent effective (Rt) reproduction numbers using software R, and calculated doubling time, the growth rate for confirmed cases from January 30 to May 4, 2020. Herd immunity was estimated using the latest Rtvalue. Results: Time distribution showed a propagated epidemic with subexponential growth. Average growth rate, 21% in the beginning, reduced to 6% after an extended lockdown (May 3). Based on early transmission dynamics, R0was 2.38 (95% confidence interval [CI] =1.79-3.07). Early, unmitigated Rt= 2.51 (95% CI = 2.05-3.14) (March 15) reduced to 1.28 (95% CI = 1.22-1.32) and was 1.83 (95% CI = 1.71-1.93) at the end of lockdown Phase 1 (April 14) and 2 (May 3), respectively. Similarly, average early doubling time (4.3 days) (standard deviation [SD] = 1.86) increased to 5.4 days (SD = 1.03) and 10.9 days (SD = 2.19). Estimated minimum 621 million recoveries are required to halt COVID-19 spread if Rtremains below 2. Conclusion: India's early response, especially stringent lockdown, has slowed COVID-19 epidemic. Increased testing, intensive case-based surveillance and containment efforts, modulated movement restrictions while protecting the vulnerable population, and continuous monitoring of transmission dynamics should be a way forward in the absence of effective treatment, vaccine, and undetermined postinfection immunity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this paper, an epidemic model based on system of ordinary differential equations is formulated by taking into account the transmission routes from symptomatic, asymptomatic and hospitalized individuals. The model is fitted to the corresponding cumulative number of hospitalized individuals (active cases) reported by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), and parameterized using the least squares method. The basic reproduction number which measures the potential spread of COVID-19 in the population is computed using the next generation operator method. Further, Lyapunov function is constructed to investigate the stability of the model around a disease-free equilibrium point. It is shown that the model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium if the basic reproduction number of the novel coronavirus transmission is less than one. Sensitivities of the model to changes in parameters are explored, and safe regions at certain threshold values of the parameters are derived. It is revealed further that the basic reproduction number can be brought to a value less than one in Nigeria, if the current effective transmission rate of the disease can be reduced by 50%. Otherwise, the number of active cases may get up to 2.5% of the total estimated population. In addition, two time-dependent control variables, namely preventive and management measures, are considered to mitigate the damaging effects of the disease using Pontryagin's maximum principle. The most cost-effective control measure is determined through cost-effectiveness analysis.

                "prompt": "COVID19 Pandemic: How Effective Are Interventive Control Measures and Is A Complete Lockdown Justified? A Comparison of Countries and States\nBackground: For fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, countries used control measures of different severity, from \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153relaxed\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 to lockdown. Drastic lockdown measures are considered more effective, but also have a negative impact on the economy. When comparing the financial value of lost lives to the losses of an economic disaster, the better option seems to be lockdown measures. Methods: We developed a new parameter, the effectiveness of control measures, calculated from the 2 nd time derivative of daily case data, and normalised to the average of the daily case data during the effective phase;and also calculated from the derivative of the logarithm of the reproductive number. We calculated this parameter and two associated parameters, i.e. effectiveness, duration of effective phase, and ratio of the 2 former parameters, for 92 countries, states and provinces, whose effective phase ended the latest on 15 May 2020. We compared these effectiveness parameters, and also the mortality during and after the effective phase, for countries with and without lockdown measures by means of the Mann-Whitney test. Results: We did not find any statistically significant difference in the three effectiveness parameters, between countries with and without lockdown (p > 0.76;very small effect size). There was also no significant difference in mortality during the effective phase (p > 0.1;very small to small effect sizes), however a significant difference after the effective phase, with higher mortality for lockdown countries. The effectiveness parameter derived from the daily case data correlated well with the parameter derived from the reproductive number (R 2 = 0.9480). The average duration of the effective phase was 17.3 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 10.5 days. Conclusions: The results indicate that lockdown measures are not necessarily superior to relaxed measures, which in turn are not necessarily a recipe for failure. Relaxed measures are, however, more economy-friendly. The higher mortality of lockdown countries is explained from the fact that, in our database, more lockdown countries than no-lockdown countries have higher mortality already during the effective phase that became significant only after the effective phase.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The programme was first rolled out on the Isle of Wight and included version 1 of the NHS contact tracing app. The aim of the study was to make a preliminary assessment of the epidemiological impact of the Test and Trace programme using publicly available data. Methods: We used COVID-19 daily case data from Public Health England to infer incidence of new infections and estimate the reproduction number (R) for each of the 150 Upper-Tier Local Authorities (UTLAs) in England and nationally, before and after the launch of the Test and Trace programme on the Isle of Wight. We used Bayesian and maximum-likelihood methods to estimate R and compared the Isle of Wight with other UTLAs using a synthetic control method. Findings: We observed significant decreases in incidence and R on the Isle of Wight immediately after the launch of the Test and Trace programme. The Isle of Wight had a marked reduction in R, from 1\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b73 before the Test and Trace programme to 0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b75 after by one of our measures, and went from having the third highest R before the Test and Trace programme, to the twelfth lowest afterwards compared with other UTLAs. Interpretation: Our results show that the epidemic on the Isle of Wight was controlled quickly and effectively after the launch of Test and Trace. Our findings highlight the need for further research to determine the causes of the reduction in the spread of the disease, as these could be translated into local and national non-pharmaceutical intervention strategies in the period before a treatment or vaccination for COVID-19 becomes available.

The effective solution for this pandemic is to recognize the nature and spread of the disease so that appropriate policies can be framed. Mathematical modelling is always at the forefront to understand and provide an adequate description of the transmission of any disease. In this research work, we have formulated a deterministic compartmental model (SEAMHCRD) including various stages of infection, such as Mild, Moderate, Severe and Critical to study the spreading of COVID-19 and estimated the model parameters by fitting the model with the reported data of ongoing pandemic in Oman. The steady-state, stability and final pandemic size of the model has been proved mathematically. The various transmission as well as transition parameters are estimated during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020. Based on the currently estimated parameters, the pandemic size is also predicted for another 100 days. Sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the key model parameters, and the parameter gamma due to contact with the symptomatic moderately infected is found to be more significant in spreading the disease. Accordingly, the corresponding basic reproduction number has also been computed using the Next Generation Matrix (NGM) method. As the value of the basic reproduction number (R0) is 0.9761 during the period from June 4th to July 30th, 2020, the disease-free equilibrium is stable.

However, hyperthermia during critical illness among ventilated COVID-19 patients in the ICU has not yet been studied. We sought to determine mortality predictors among ventilated COVID-19 ICU patients and we hypothesized that fever in the ICU is predictive of mortality. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 103 ventilated COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU between March 14 and May 27, 2020. Final follow-up was June 5, 2020. Patients discharged from the ICU or who died were included. Patients still admitted to the ICU at final follow-up were excluded. RESULTS: 103 patients were included, 40 survived and 63(61.1%) died. Deceased patients were older {66 years[IQR18] vs 62.5[IQR10], (p = 0.0237)}, more often male {48(68%) vs 22(55%), (p = 0.0247)}, had lower initial oxygen saturation {86.0%[IQR18] vs 91.5%[IQR11.5], (p = 0.0060)}, and had lower pH nadir than survivors {7.10[IQR0.2] vs 7.30[IQR0.2] (p < 0.0001)}. Patients had higher peak temperatures during ICU stay as compared to hospital presentation {103.3\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F[IQR1.7] vs 100.0\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F[IQR3.5], (p < 0.0001)}. Deceased patients had higher peak ICU temperatures than survivors {103.6\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F[IQR2.0] vs 102.9\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F[IQR1.4], (p = 0.0008)}. Increasing peak temperatures were linearly associated with mortality. Febrile patients who underwent targeted temperature management to achieve normothermia did not have different outcomes than those not actively cooled. Multivariable analysis revealed 60% and 75% higher risk of mortality with peak temperature greater than 103\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F and 104\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0F respectively; it also confirmed hyperthermia, age, male sex, and acidosis to be predictors of mortality. CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to identify ICU hyperthermia as predictive of mortality in ventilated COVID-19 patients. Additional predictors included male sex, age, and acidosis. With COVID-19 cases increasing, identification of ICU mortality predictors is crucial to improve risk stratification, resource management, and patient outcomes.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We develop a stochastic model of an outbreak based on a time-varying variant of the Crump-Mode-Jagers branching process. This model accommodates a time-varying reproduction number and a time-varying distribution for the generation interval. We then derive renewal-like integral equations for incidence, cumulative incidence and prevalence under this model. We show that the equations for incidence and prevalence are consistent with the so-called back-calculation relationship. We analyse two particular cases of these integral equations, one that arises from a Bellman-Harris process and one that arises from an inhomogeneous Poisson process model of transmission. We outline an argument to show that the incidence integral equations that arise from both of these specific models agree with the renewal equation used ubiquitously in infectious disease modelling. We present a numerical discretisation scheme to solve these equations, and use this scheme to estimate rates of transmission from serological prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and historical incidence data on Influenza, Measles, SARS and Smallpox.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In our study, we explore the dynamics of these two measures to test whether the virus has reached its equilibrium point and to identify the main factors explaining R and CFR variability across countries. DesignA retrospective study of publicly available country-level data. SettingFifty countries having the highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases at the end of July 2021. ParticipantsAggregated data including 182 085 182 COVID-19 cases confirmed in the selected fifty countries from the start of the epidemic to July 31, 2021. Primary and secondary outcome measuresThe daily values of COVID-19 R and CFR measures were estimated using country-level data from the Our World in Data website. ResultsThe mean values of country-level moving averages of R and CFR went down from 1.114 and 5.51%, respectively, on July 31, 2020 to 1.059 and 2.35% on January 31, 2021 and to 1.010 and 2.17% by July 31, 2021. In parallel, the cross-country variance of R and CFR moving averages decreased from 0.015 and 0.19%, respectively, on July 31, 2020, to 0.004 and 0.02% on January 31, 2021, and stayed on a similar level by July 31, 2021. ConclusionsThe continuous decrease in the country-level moving averages of R, down to the level of 1.0, accompanied by repeated outbreaks (\"waves\") in various countries, may indicate that COVID-19 has reached its point of a stable endemic equilibrium. Only a prohibitively high level of herd immunity (about 70%) can stop the endemic by reaching a stable disease-free equilibrium. Also, the average percentage of fully vaccinated population appears to be the only statistically significant factor associated with country-specific CFR, bringing it close to the level of a seasonal flu (about 0.1%) after vaccinating more than a half of a countrys population. Thus, while the currently available vaccines prove to be effective in reducing the mortality from the existing COVID-19 variants, they are unlikely to stop the spread of the virus in the foreseeable future. It is noteworthy that no statistically significant effects of government measures restricting the peoples behavior (such as lockdowns) were found in the analyzed data.

Therefore, understanding the dynamics of transmission is very important. In this paper, the COVID-19 mathematical model has been formulated, analyzed, and validated using incident data from West Java Province, Indonesia. The model made considers the asymptomatic and symptomatic compartments and decreased immunity. The model is formulated in the form of a system of differential equations, where the population is divided into seven compartments, namely Susceptible Population ( S 0 ) , Exposed Population ( E ) , Asymptomatic Infection Population ( I A ) , Symptomatic Infection Population ( Y S ) , Recovered Population ( Z ) , Susceptible Populations previously infected ( Z 0 ) , and Quarantine population ( Q ) . The results show that there has been an outbreak of COVID-19 in West Java Province, Indonesia. This can be seen from the basic reproduction number of this model, which is 3.180126127 ( R 0 > 1 ) . Also, the numerical simulation results show that waning immunity can increase the occurrence of outbreaks; and a period of isolation can slow down the process of spreading COVID-19. So if a strict social distancing policy is enforced like a quarantine, the outbreak will lessen.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

It is shown that for normally expected lifetimes of a virus on fomites, the dynamics of the populations are nearly indistinguishable from the case without fomites. With additional information, such as the change in social contacts following a lockdown, however, it is shown that, under the assumption that the reproduction number for direct infection is proportional to the number of social contacts, the population dynamics may be used to place meaningful statistical constraints on the role of fomites that are not affected by the lockdown. The case of the Spring 2020 UK lockdown in response to COVID-19 is presented as an illustration. An upper limit is found on the transmission rate by contaminated fomites of fewer than 1 in 30 per day per infectious person (95% CL) when social contact information is taken into account. Applied to postal deliveries and food packaging, the upper limit on the contaminated fomite transmission rate corresponds to a probability below 1 in 70 (95% CL) that a contaminated fomite transmits the infection. The method presented here may be helpful for guiding health policy over the contribution of some fomites to the spread of infection in other epidemics until more complete risk assessments based on mechanistic modelling or epidemiological investigations may be completed.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Rehabilitation care can support people to return to work. In Germany, rehabilitation care to return to work is mostly provided in specialised clinics. The aim of the Rehapro-SERVE study is to reduce work disability days by facilitating rehabilitation care planning using a digital communication platform. To investigate the feasibility, we will test the implementation of the digital platform and evaluate the study procedures. The Rehapro-SERVE study is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMAS) (grant number: 661R0053K1). METHOD: The feasibility study includes a two-armed unblinded block randomised controlled study (RCT) without follow-up assessments as well as an interview study. Participants for the RCT (n = 16) are primary care patients with a minimum of 4 weeks of absence from work due to musculoskeletal, oncological or psychological conditions and at high risk of early retirement. Eligibility criteria are age 40 to 60 years; minimum of 4 weeks continuous sick leave before recruitment due to musculoskeletal, mental health or oncological conditions; and being at high risk of early retirement. Patients will be recruited from 8 primary care practices in urban and rural areas in Hesse, Germany. Following baseline assessments, patients will be randomised to either digitalised care planning (treatment) or a control group. The digitalised care planning platform will include the patients\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 primary care physicians, jobcentres and public health physicians to decide on a tailored return-to-work programme. The collaboration will be supported by a case administrator and, if considered beneficial, a social worker for the patient. An interview study will evaluate the acceptability of the study procedures and the intervention. DISCUSSION: The use of a digital communication platform enables stakeholders to exchange information and discuss rehabilitation care planning in a timely fashion. The results of the feasibility study will lead to the adaptation of study procedures for the main study. The results will support the design and conduct of similar studies including digital applications in primary care or across different healthcare settings.

METHODS: Data were retrieved from published national surveillance data between 24 February and 30 June 2020. To show the impact of the Government introduced public health intervention early in the epidemic, we used a simple disease-transmission model equation of the 2019-n CoV epidemic. RESULTS: From all confirmed cases, the rates of intensive care unit admission were 4.56% (1824). We estimated an R(0) of 3.11 with no intervention would result in nearly the entire population of Oman being infected within 65 days. A reduction of the R(0) to 1.51 provided an estimated 89,056 confirmed cases, with 167 deaths or 0.4% mortality by June 30 with a requirement of 4052 intensive care unit beds. The current scenario (24 February to 30 June 2020) indicates an R(0) of 1.41, resulting in 40,070 confirmed COVID-19 cases, 176 deaths and 69% of confirmed cases recovered.

Taiwan successfully contained local COVID-19 transmission after the initial imported cases in the country in early 2020 after applying the above-mentioned interventions. In order to explain the containment of the disease spread in Taiwan and understand the efficiency of different non-pharmaceutical interventions, a mathematical model has been developed. A stochastic model was implemented in order to estimate the effectiveness of mask wearing together with case isolation and contact tracing. We investigated different approaches towards mask usage, estimated the effect of the interventions on the basic reproduction number (R(0)), and simulated the possibility of controlling the outbreak. With the assumption that non-medical and medical masks have 20% and 50% efficiency, respectively, case isolation works on 100%, 70% of all people wear medical masks, and R(0) = 2.5, there is almost 80% probability of outbreak control with 60% contact tracing, whereas for non-medical masks the highest probability is only about 20%. With a large proportion of infectiousness before the onset of symptoms (40%) and the presence of asymptomatic cases, the investigated interventions (isolation of cases, contact tracing, and mask wearing by all people), implemented on a high level, can help to control the disease spread. Superspreading events have also been included in our model in order to estimate their impact on the outbreak and to understand how restrictions on gathering and social distancing can help to control the outbreak.

Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (Rt) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection during the first 10 days of the outbreak in seven Latin American countries with the highest incidence of cases as of March 23, 2020. Furthermore, we chose to compare the seven countries with Spain and Italy given their history with the virus. METHODS: Incidence data retrieved from the COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University were analyzed. The Rt was calculated for the first 10 days of the epidemic in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, and Peru. Rt estimations were compared with Spain and Italy values for the same interval. RESULTS: The median Rt for the first 10 days of the COVID-19 epidemic were 2.90 (2.67-3.14) for Spain and 2.83 (2.7-2.96) for Italy. Latin American Rt estimations were higher in Ecuador (3.95(3.7-4.21)), Panama (3.95(3.7-4.21)), and Brazil (3.95(3.7-4.21)). The smallest one was observed in Peru (2.36(2.11-2.63)). All Latin American countries had Rt greater than 2. CONCLUSIONS: The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin America suggested a high Rt.

The high HIV-1 mutation rate leads to viral diversity, immune evasion, and consequent antiretroviral drug resistance. While CRISPR-spCas9 can eliminate latent proviral DNA, its efficacy is limited by HIV strain diversity and precision target cell delivery. METHODS: A library of guide RNAs (gRNAs) designed to disrupt five HIV-1 exons (tat(1-2)/rev(1-2)/gp41) was constructed. The gRNAs were derived from a conseensus sequence of the transcriptional regulator tat from 4004 HIV-1 strains. Efficacy was affirmed by gRNA cell entry through transfection, electroporation, or by lentivirus or lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery. Treated cells were evaluated for viral excision by monitoring HIV-1 DNA, RNA, protein, and progeny virus levels. FINDINGS: Virus was reduced in all transmitted founder strains by 82 and 94% after CRISPR TatDE transfection or lentivirus treatments, respectively. No recorded off-target cleavages were detected. Electroporation of TatDE ribonucleoprotein and delivery of LNP TatDE gRNA and spCas9 mRNA to latently infected cells resulted in up to 100% viral excision. Protection against HIV-1-challenge or induction of virus during latent infection, in primary or transformed CD4+ T cells or monocytes was achieved. We propose that multi-exon gRNA TatDE disruption delivered by LNPs enables translation for animal and human testing. INTERPRETATION: These results provide \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00c5\u201cproof of concept\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 for CRISPR gRNA treatments for HIV-1 elimination.

To evaluate the effectiveness of applied policies, the number of cases and death before and after the interventions studied and the effective reproduction number of the infection was analyzed under various scenarios. The SEIR generic model was applied to capture the dynamic of the pandemic in Iran. It is assumed that changes in reproduction number are responses to interventions. Depending on how responsive people to the government interventions, the effectiveness of each intervention has been investigated. Based on the model results, the peak of the total number of infected individuals will occur around the end of May and the start of June 2021. It is revealed that the outbreak had been able to be smoothed if the government had continued the full lockdown and strict quarantine. The result will allow for the assessment of the effects of different government interventions in new outbreaks.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

There is still uncertainty around the scale and duration of this exposure event. This has implications for the estimated transmissibility of the coronavirus and as such, these potential scenarios should be explored. Methods: We used a stochastic branching process model, parameterised with available data where possible and otherwise informed by the 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak, to simulate the Wuhan outbreak. We evaluated scenarios for the following parameters: the size, and duration of the initial transmission event, the serial interval, and the reproduction number (R0). We restricted model simulations based on the number of observed cases on the 25th of January, accepting samples that were within a 5% interval on either side of this estimate. Results: Using a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval suggested a larger initial transmission event and a higher R0 estimate. Using a SARs-like serial interval we found that the most likely scenario produced an R0 estimate between 2-2.7 (90% credible interval (CrI)). A pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in an R0 estimate between 2-3 (90% CrI). There were other plausible scenarios with smaller events sizes and longer duration that had comparable R0 estimates. There were very few simulations that were able to reproduce the observed data when R0 was less than 1. Conclusions: Our results indicate that an R0 of less than 1 was highly unlikely unless the size of the initial exposure event was much greater than currently reported. We found that R0 estimates were comparable across scenarios with decreasing event size and increasing duration. Scenarios with a pre-intervention SARS-like serial interval resulted in a higher R0 and were equally plausible to scenarios with SARs-like serial intervals.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We analyzed the trend, modelling and impact assessment of COVID-19 cases of Nepal from 23rd January 2020 to 30th April 2020 to portray the scenario of COVID-19 after the first phase of lockdown. Exponential smoothing state-space and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models were constructed to forecast the cases. Susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) model was fit to estimate the basic reproduction number (Ro) of COVID-19 in Nepal. There has been increase in the number of cases but the overall growth in COVID-19 was not high. Statistical modelling has shown that COVID-19 cases may continue to increase exponentially in Nepal. The basic reproduction number in Nepal being maintained at low level of 1.08 for the period of 23rd January to 30th April 2020 is an indication of effectiveness of lockdown in containing the COVID-19 spread. The models further suggest that COVID-19 might persist until December 2020 with peak cases in August 2020. On the other hand, basic reproduction number of 1.25 was computed for total cases reported for the 22nd March to 30th April 2020 period implying that COVID-19 may remain for at least for a year in the country.

Nevertheless, empirical evidence of the effectiveness of different interventions on the containment of the epidemic was inconsistent. METHODS: We retrieved time-series intervention policy data for 145 countries from the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker from December 31, 2019, to July 1, 2020, which included 8 containment and closure policies. We investigated the association of timeliness, stringency, and duration of intervention with cumulative infections per million population on July 1, 2020. We introduced a novel counterfactual estimator to estimate the effects of these interventions on COVID-19 time-varying reproduction number (R(t)). RESULTS: There is some evidence that earlier implementation, longer durations, and more strictness of intervention policies at the early but not middle stage were associated with reduced infections of COVID-19. The counterfactual model proved to have controlled for unobserved time-varying confounders and established a valid causal relationship between policy intervention and R(t) reduction. The average intervention effect revealed that all interventions significantly decrease R(t) after their implementation. R(t) decreased by 30% (22%-41%) in 25 to 32 days after policy intervention. Among the 8 interventions, school closing, workplace closing, and public events cancellation demonstrated the strongest and most consistent evidence of associations. CONCLUSIONS: Our study provides more reliable evidence of the quantitative effects of policy interventions on the COVID-19 epidemic and suggested that stricter public activity interventions should be implemented at the early stage of the epidemic for improved containment.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

While the disparities are clear, the reasons underlying the rapidity of disease spread - characterized by the basic reproduction ratio R 0 - in these communities are less so. Here, we investigate the relative impact of disparities in socioeconomic, environmental, and lung health factors on R 0 across 12 major metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the US at the county-level. We inferred county-level R 0 values using an established metapopulation epidemiological model corresponding to the period 1 March-30 April 2020 marked by a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases across the US and implementation of strict lockdown measures. We find that disparities in long-term, ambient PM2.5 exposure (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter 2.5 \u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00bcm or less) and population density have an outsized effect on R 0 in comparison to disparities in the other factors. We also find that the effect of increasing population density on R 0 is dependent on ambient PM2.5 mass concentrations. PM2.5 exposure has a well-established causal effect with increased risks and severe outcomes during previous infectious disease outbreaks. Overall, we find the largest disparities in PM2.5 exposure, population density, and associated increase in R 0 among the Hispanic-American population, followed by Asian-American and African-American populations, respectively. Longstanding geographic segregation of minority communities has led to extremely large fluctuations in county-level racial and ethnic minority fractions. As such, we conclude by providing each MSA with a roadmap for identifying which communities should be targeted for PM2.5 mitigation policy implementation. The methodology and results of this study may be extrapolatable to the rest of the world toward discerning the consequences of population density and PM2.5 disparities in COVID-19 spread. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 The Author(s).

The strategy is assessed in terms of the value of the reproductive ratio R(0). We consider a general framework and analyse six different specific cases. The same antiviral strategy is simulated in all models, but they slightly differ in the compartmental structure. These differences correspond to different underlying assumptions concerning the timing of the intervention and the selection of individuals who receive treatment. It is shown that these details can have a strong influence on the predicted effectiveness of the strategy: for instance, with R(0) = 1.8 in absence of treatment, different models predict that with treatment R(0) can become as low as 0.4 or as high as 1.3; still, in all models 70% of infected individuals are treated and the infectiousness of treated individuals is reduced by 80%. A particular assumption that can be included when modelling influenza is time-varying infectivity. We consider a specific model to verify if the predicted effectiveness of antiviral treatment is influenced by the inclusion of this assumption. We compare the results obtained with constant and variable infectivity, in relation also to the time of intervention. It is likely that existing differences in the predictions of the effect of control measures depend on such modelling details.

This study aims at clarifying the transmission patterns and the driving mechanism that contributed to the COVID-19 epidemics across the provinces of China. Thus a new dynamical transmission model is established by ordinary differential system. The model takes into account the hidden circulation of COVID-19 virus among/within humans, which incorporates the spatial diffusion of infection by parameterizing human mobility. Theoretical analysis indicates that the basic reproduction number is a unique epidemic threshold, which can unite infectivity in each region by human mobility, and can totally determine whether COVID-19 proceeds among multiple regions. By validating the model with real epidemic data in China, it is found that (1) if without any intervention, COVID-19 would overrun China within three months, resulting in more than 1.1 billion infections;(2) high frequency of human mobility can trigger COVID-19 diffusion across each province in China, no matter where the initial infection locates;(3) travel restrictions and other non-pharmaceutical interventions must be implemented simultaneously for disease control;and (4) infection sites in central and east (rather than west and northeast) of China would easily stimulate quick diffusion of COVID-19 in the whole country.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

For this one often considers the reproduction number which measures the amount of secondary cases produced by a single infectious individual. While estimates of this quantity are readily available on the national level, subnational estimates, e.g. on the county level, pose more difficulties since only few incidences occur there. However, as countermeasures to the pandemic are usually enforced on the subnational level, such estimates are of great interest to assess the efficacy of the measures taken, and to guide future policy. We present a novel extension of the well established estimator of the country level reproduction number to the county level by applying techniques from small-area estimation. This new estimator yields sensible estimates of reproduction numbers both on the country and county level. It can handle low and highly variable case counts on the county level, and may be used to distinguish local outbreaks from more widespread ones. We demonstrate the capabilities of our novel estimator by a simulation study and by applying the estimator to German case data.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The current COVID-19 situation is still now concerning, though the vaccination program is running. In this study, we considered a COVID-19 model with a double-dose vaccination strategy to control the current outbreak situation in Bangladesh. The fundamental qualitative analysis of this mathematical model has been performed. The conditions of positive invariance, boundedness with suitable initial conditions were analyzed. We have estimated the basic reproduction number ([Formula: see text]) for disease transmission and determined that our model contains two equilibrium points: the disease-free equilibrium and a disease-endemic equilibrium. We used the Routh-Hurwitz criteria to determine the stability of the equilibria. The disease will be eradicated from the community if [Formula: see text] < 1, otherwise the disease persists in the population. To support the qualitative analysis of our model, we performed numerical simulations using MATLAB routine and estimated model parameters. Sensitivity analysis is used to explore the association for Mild and Critical cases concerning the corresponding model parameters. We observed that the most significant parameter to spread the virus is the transmission rate. The numerical simulations showed that a full dose vaccination program significantly reduces the mild and critical cases and has potential impact to eradicate the virus from the community.

We refer to quarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases. In the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of contact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in time, representing policies that evolve in different stages. We obtain an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R0 in terms of the parameters of the disease and of the control policies. In this way we can quantify the effect that isolation and testing have in the evolution of the epidemic. We present a series of simulations to illustrate different realistic scenarios. From the expression of R0 and the simulations we conclude that isolation (social distancing) and testing among asymptomatic cases are fundamental actions to control the epidemic, and the stricter these measures are and the sooner they are implemented, the more effective they are in flattening the curve of infections. Additionally, we show that people that remain in isolation significantly reduce their probability of contagion, so risk groups should be recommended to maintain a low contact rate during the course of the epidemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

To do this, we developed a Susceptible\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Exposed\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Infectious\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Recovered\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Dead (SEIRD) model that estimated unreported infections from the reported number of deaths. Our approach relied on the fact that observed deaths were less likely to be affected by ascertainment biases than reported infections. Interestingly, we estimated that the basic reproductive number (R0) was 2.43 (95%CI = 2.42\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.44) at the beginning of the epidemic and that 92.9% (95%CI = 92.5%\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015393.1%) of total cases were not reported. Similarly, the proportion of unreported new infections by day ranged from 52.1% to 100%, with a total of 91.8% (95%CI = 91.6%\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015392.1%) of infections going unreported. Agreement between our estimates and those from previous studies proves that our approach is reliable for estimating the prevalence and incidence of undocumented SARS-CoV-2 infections. Once it has been tested on Chinese data, our model could be applied to other countries with different surveillance and testing policies.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We discuss how the underlying dynamics depends on the carrying capacity K: from a simple dynamics to a more complex. This can also help in understanding the appearance of more complicated dynamics, for example, chaos and periodic oscillations, for large values of K. It is also presented that pathogens can invade in population and their invasion depends on the carrying capacity K which shows that the progression of disease in population depends on carrying capacity. More specifically, we establish all possible scenarios (the so-called transition diagrams) describing an evolution of an (always unique) locally stable equilibrium state (with only non-negative compartments) for fixed fundamental parameters (density independent transmission and vital rates) as a function of the carrying capacity K. An important implication of our results is the following important observation. Note that one can regard the value of K as the natural \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153size\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 (the capacity) of a habitat. From this point of view, an isolation of individuals (the strategy which showed its efficiency for COVID-19 in various countries) into smaller resp. larger groups can be modelled by smaller resp. bigger values of K. Then we conclude that the infection dynamics becomes more complex for larger groups, as it fairly maybe expected for values of the reproduction number [Formula: see text] . We show even more, that for the values [Formula: see text] there are several (in fact four different) distinguished scenarios where the infection complexity (the number of nonzero infected classes) arises with growing K. Our approach is based on a bifurcation analysis which allows to generalize considerably the previous Lotka-Volterra model considered previously in Ghersheen et al.

METHODS: Data (official statistics) on the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 at the start of the outbreak (before any confinement rules were declared) were retrieved in the 15 largest countries in Western Europe, allowing us to estimate the exponential growth rate of the disease. The rate was then combined with estimates of the distribution of the generation interval as reconstructed from the literature. RESULTS: Despite the possible unreliability of some official statistics about COVID-19, the spread of the disease appears to be remarkably similar in most European countries, allowing us to estimate an average R0 in Western Europe of 2.2 (95% CI: 1.9-2.6).

Public health authorities are hesitant in introducing social distancing interventions due to societal disruption and productivity losses. This study estimates the effectiveness and total cost (from a societal perspective, with a lifespan time horizon) of a comprehensive range of social distancing and antiviral drug strategies, under a range of pandemic severity categories. METHODS: An economic analysis was conducted using a simulation model of a community of ~30,000 in Australia. Data from the 2009 pandemic was used to derive relationships between the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and hospitalization rates for each of five pandemic severity categories, with CFR ranging from 0.1% to 2.5%. RESULTS: For a pandemic with basic reproduction number R(0) = 1.8, adopting no interventions resulted in total costs ranging from $441 per person for a pandemic at category 1 (CFR 0.1%) to $8,550 per person at category 5 (CFR 2.5%). For severe pandemics of category 3 (CFR 0.75%) and greater, a strategy combining antiviral treatment and prophylaxis, extended school closure and community contact reduction resulted in the lowest total cost of any strategy, costing $1,584 per person at category 5. This strategy was highly effective, reducing the attack rate to 5%. With low severity pandemics costs are dominated by productivity losses due to illness and social distancing interventions, whereas higher severity pandemic costs are dominated by healthcare costs and costs arising from productivity losses due to death. CONCLUSIONS: For pandemics in high severity categories the strategies with the lowest total cost to society involve rigorous, sustained social distancing, which are considered unacceptable for low severity pandemics due to societal disruption and cost.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This system generates estimates of the current reproductive rate, Rt, together with predictions of future daily deaths and clearly outperforms a number of alternative forecasting systems that have been presented recently.

The aim of this study is to investigate the implementation of the ABCDEF-bundle and supportive care provided to patients with COVID-19 infections in ICUs. Methods: This was a world-wide two-day point prevalence study, on June 3 and July 1, 2020. A total of 212 ICUs in 38 countries (166 ICUs on Day 1 and 212 on Day 2) participated. Clinicians in each participating ICU completed web-based online surveys. The implementation rate for elements of the ABCDEF-bundle, other supportive ICU care measures and implementation associated structures were investigated. RESULTS Data for 262 patients was collected during the two-day study. Of patients included, 124 (47.3%) underwent mechanical ventilation (MV) and 12 (4.6%) patients were treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). The proportion of patients with implementation of each element was: Element A (regular pain assessment) 45%;B (both spontaneous awakening and breathing trials) 28%;C (regular sedation assessment) 52%;D (regular delirium assessment) 38%;E (early mobility and exercise) 47%;and F (family engagement and empowerment) 16%. The implementation of element E for patients on MV was 16% and ECMO was 17%. Supportive care, such as providing protein throughout the ICU stay (under 1.2g/kg for more than 50% of the patients) and introduction of an ICU diary (25%) was inadequate. A higher implementation rate of elements A and D were recognized in ICUs with specific protocols for ICU care and lower numbers of ICU beds exclusively for patients with COVID-19 infection. Element E was implemented at a higher rate in ICUs with more ICU beds for patients with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSIONS This worldwide two-day point prevalence study found low implementation of the ABCDEF-bundle.

We examine eleven types of activity spaces and find heterogeneous impacts across countries, yet we also find that non-essential activity spaces tend to have larger impacts than essential ones. Contrary to common beliefs, settlement size and density are not positively associated with reproduction numbers. Further, the impacts of closing activity spaces vary with settlement types and are consistently lower in larger settlements in all sample countries, suggesting more complex pattern of virus transmission in large settlements. This work takes first steps in systematically evaluating the epistemological risks of places at multiple scales, which contributes to knowledge in urban resilience, health and livability.

Since there is no effective vaccine and treatment for this virus, therefore, the only way to mitigate this infection is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social-distancing, community lockdown, quarantine, hospitalization or self-isolation and contact-tracing. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model to explore the transmission dynamics and possible control of the COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan, one of the Asian countries with a high burden of disease with more than 200,000 confirmed infected cases so far. Initially, a mathematical model without optimal control is formulated and some of the basic necessary analysis of the model, including stability results of the disease-free equilibrium is presented. It is found that the model is stable around the disease-free equilibrium both locally and globally when the basic reproduction number is less than unity. Despite the basic analysis of the model, we further consider the confirmed infected COVID-19 cases documented in Pakistan from March 1, till May 28, 2020 and estimate the model parameters using the least square fitting tools from statistics and probability theory. The results show that the model output is in good agreement with the reported COVID-19 infected cases.

The effect of low (or mild), moderate, and comparatively strict control interventions like social-distancing, quarantine rate, (or contact-tracing of suspected people) and hospitalization (or self-isolation) of testing positive COVID-19 cases are shown graphically. It is observed that the most effective strategy to minimize the disease burden is the implementation of maintaining a strict social-distancing and contact-tracing to quarantine the exposed people. Furthermore, we carried out the global sensitivity analysis of the most crucial parameter known as the basic reproduction number using the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) and the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) techniques. The proposed model is then reformulated by adding the time-dependent control variables u 1(t) for quarantine and u 2(t) for the hospitalization interventions and present the necessary optimality conditions using the optimal control theory and Pontryagin's maximum principle. Finally, the impact of constant and optimal control interventions on infected individuals is compared graphically.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We aimed to estimate the reproductive number of SARS-CoV-2 in the Hubei Province and evaluate the risk of an acute respiratory coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak outside China by using a mathematical model and stochastic simulations. RESULTS: We constructed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics, estimated the rate of transmission, and calculated the reproductive number in Hubei Province by using case-report data from January 11 to February 6, 2020. The possible number of secondary cases outside China was estimated by stochastic simulations in various scenarios of reductions in the duration to quarantine and rate of transmission. The rate of transmission was estimated as 0.8238 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8095-0.8382), and the basic reproductive number as 4.1192 (95% CI 4.0473-4.1912). Assuming the same rate of transmission as in Hubei Province, the possibility of no local transmission is 54.9% with a 24-h quarantine strategy, and the possibility of more than 20 local transmission cases is 7% outside of China. CONCLUSION: The reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is significantly higher compared to that of the previous SARS epidemic in China. This implies that human-to-human transmission is a significant factor for contagion in Hubei Province. Results of the stochastic simulation emphasize the role of quarantine implementation, which is critical to prevent and control the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak outside China.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Empirical Modelling of Confirmed COVID-19 Cases in Nigeria: Forecasts and Implications\nThe world greeted the New Year 2020 with varying degrees of optimism. Overall, forecasts for 2020 were made with cautious optimism given the global slowdown in 2019. While at this, the Chinese city of Wuhan was being ravaged by a deadly severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), which caused the 2019-nCoV or COVID-19 disease. The disease described by the World Health Organisation as a pandemic has dealt a severe blow on the health system and economic activities on a global scale. Substantial uncertainties surround the appreciation of the precise nature of the health challenge, its spread over time and other aspects all of which further complicate the deployment of appropriate measures in clinical interventions as well as dampen the effectiveness of broader macroeconomic policies especially for the developing countries with their multifarious structural weaknesses. This paper explored the nature of the COVID-19 both in terms of the shape of its growth curve and then estimated the basic reproduction number on the one hand, while also providing forecast of the path of the pandemic, particularly the number of infections for Nigeria. The Poisson, Negative Binomial and Wallinga and Teunis (2004) modelling techniques were used on data from Nigeria. As at April 28, 2020, the COVID-19 curve for Nigeria was upward sloping in nature with the steepness becoming marked from around 30 March 2020. This was about the same period that government ordered the lockdown of the epicentres of the pandemic. Also, the basic reproduction number was both time variant and relatively high for the national (2.25) and subnational [Lagos (3.44) and Abuja (2.77)] cases. The projections from the two standard models suggested that the incidence of infections may just begin to taper off by the end of the second quarter before stabilising at about the third quarter of 2020. This is suggestive of huge trade-offs with respect to losses in potential GDP and thereby of the need for government and other stakeholders to come up with proactive steps to mitigate the severity and reduce the duration of the imminent economic recession that will culminate.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This study examined relationships between changes in sleep and perceived impacts to social and financial stability due to the pandemic. METHODS: Participants were 155 individuals who completed the Nogales Cardiometabolic Health and Sleep (NOCHES) and were contacted about completing a COVID sub-study (95% Hispanic/Latino). Participants were asked if the COVID-19 pandemic was causing them to feel more socially isolated, negatively impacting their finances, causing increased worry about finances, affecting their primary job, causing a job loss, and impacting their belief life will one day return to normal. In addition, they were asked to report the degree to which they experienced pandemic-related changes to sleep, including a regularity, overall improvement/worsening, initial and middle-of-the-night insomnia, daytime sleepiness, and napping. Logistic regression analyses were adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomics, and mental health (PHQ4). RESULTS: Those who kept a more regular schedule had lower odds of endorsing isolation (OR=0.32,p<0.0005) and higher odds of believing things will return to normal (OR=1.67,p=0.041). Those whose sleep improved also had lower odds of feeling isolated (OR=0.40,p=0.005). Those with worsened sleep had increased odds of feeling isolated (OR=2.14,p=0.023), experiencing a financial impact (OR=1.85,p=0.016) and increased financial worry (OR=1.71,p=0.033), and lower odds of believing things will return to normal (OR=0.53,p=0.012). More initial insomnia was associated with isolation (OR=3.62,p=0.001), financial impact, (OR=1.89,p=0.015), financial worry (OR=1.87,p=0.016) and job impact (OR=1.95,p=0.010). More middle-of-the-night insomnia was associated with financial worry (OR=1.82,p=0.016) and job impact (OR=1.93,p=0.009). More sleepiness was associated with job loss (OR=1.84,p=0.043). More napping was associated with financial impact (OR=1.89,p=0.017) and worry (OR=1.88,p=0.017), impact to job (OR=1.89,p=0.016) or lost job (OR=1.81,p=0.041), and decreased likelihood of believing things will return to normal (OR=0.45,p=0.003). CONCLUSION: Pandemic-related stress was linked with sleep disturbances. Worse sleep was indicative of increased social isolation, greater financial fears, more job-related impacts and less of a general sense that things would return to normal.

We assessed the risk, disparities, and outcomes of COVID-19 in patients with six major CLDs. FINDINGS: Patients with a recent medical encounter for CLD were at significantly increased risk for COVID-19 compared with patients without CLD, with the strongest effect in patients with chronic non-alcoholic liver disease [adjusted odd ratio (AOR)=13.11, 95% CI: 12.49\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015313.76, p < 0.001] and non-alcoholic cirrhosis (AOR=11.53, 95% CI: 10.69\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015312.43, p < 0.001), followed by chronic hepatitis C (AOR=8.93, 95% CI:8.25\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01539.66, p < 0.001), alcoholic liver damage (AOR=7.05, 95% CI:6.30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01537.88, p < 0.001), alcoholic liver cirrhosis (AOR=7.00, 95% CI:6.15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01537.97, p < 0.001) and chronic hepatitis B (AOR=4.37, 95% CI:3.35\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01535.69, p < 0.001). African Americans with CLD were twice more likely to develop COVID-19 than Caucasians. Patients with COVID-19 and a recent encounter for CLD had a death rate of 10.3% (vs. 5.5% among COVID-19 patients without CLD, p < 0.001) and a hospitalization rate of 41.0% (vs. 23.9% among COVID-19 patients without CLD, p < 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Patients with CLD, especially African Americans, were at increased risk for COVID-19, highlighting the need to protect these patients from exposure to virus infection.

In the suggested fractional order COVID-19 [Formula: see text] paradigm, the impact of changing quarantining and contact rates are examined. The stability of the proposed fractional order COVID-19 [Formula: see text] paradigm is studied and a parametric rule for the fundamental reproduction number formula is given. The existence and uniqueness of stable solution of the proposed fractional order COVID-19 [Formula: see text] paradigm are proved. Since the genetic algorithm is a common powerful optimization method, we propose an optimum control strategy based on the genetic algorithm.

Fifty-three participants (85%) had lingering symptoms, most commonly dyspnea (69%) and cough (58%). Forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) declined as COVID-19 severity increased (P < 0.05) but these values did not correlate with respiratory symptoms. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis of plasma biomarker profiles clustered participants by past COVID-19 severity. Lipocalin-2 (LCN2), MMP-7, and HGF identified by our analysis were significantly higher in the ICU group (P < 0.05), inversely correlated with FVC and DLCO (P < 0.05), and were confirmed in a separate validation cohort (n = 53).CONCLUSIONSubjective respiratory symptoms are common after acute COVID-19 illness but do not correlate with COVID-19 severity or pulmonary function.

A modelling and simulation framework is provided using SARS-CoV-2 as an example, considering applications for both treatment and prophylaxis. METHODS: A target cell-limited model was used to quantify the viral infection dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in a pooled population of 105 infected patients. Parameter estimates from the resulting model were used to simulate and compare the impact of various interventions against meaningful viral load endpoints. RESULTS: Robust parameter estimates were obtained for the basic reproduction number, viral release rate and infected-cell mortality from the infection model. These estimates were informed by the largest dataset currently available for SARS-CoV-2 viral time course. The utility of this model was demonstrated using simulations, which hypothetically introduced inhibitory or stimulatory drug mechanisms at various target sites within the viral life-cycle. We show that early intervention is crucial to achieving therapeutic benefit when monotherapy is administered. In contrast, combination regimens of two or three drugs may provide improved outcomes if treatment is initiated late. The latter is relevant to SARS-CoV-2, where the period between infection and symptom onset is relatively long. CONCLUSIONS: The use of in silico models can provide viral load predictions that can rationalize therapeutic strategies against an emerging viral pathogen.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

                "prompt": "Inference of malaria reproduction numbers in three elimination settings by combining temporal data and distance metrics\nIndividual-level geographic information about malaria cases, such as the GPS coordinates of residence or health facility, is often collected as part of surveillance in near-elimination settings, but could be more effectively utilised to infer transmission dynamics, in conjunction with additional information such as symptom onset time and genetic distance. However, in the absence of data about the flow of parasites between populations, the spatial scale of malaria transmission is often not clear. As a result, it is important to understand the impact of varying assumptions about the spatial scale of transmission on key metrics of malaria transmission, such as reproduction numbers. We developed a method which allows the flexible integration of distance metrics (such as Euclidian distance, genetic distance or accessibility matrices) with temporal information into a single inference framework to infer malaria reproduction numbers. Twelve scenarios were defined, representing different assumptions about the likelihood of transmission occurring over different geographic distances and likelihood of missing infections (as well as high and low amounts of uncertainty in this estimate). These scenarios were applied to four individual level datasets from malaria eliminating contexts to estimate individual reproduction numbers and how they varied over space and time. Model comparison suggested that including spatial information improved models as measured by second order AIC (\u00c3\u017d\u00e2\u20ac\u009dAICc), compared to time only results. Across scenarios and across datasets, including spatial information tended to increase the seasonality of temporal patterns in reproduction numbers and reduced noise in the temporal distribution of reproduction numbers. The best performing parameterisations assumed long-range transmission (> 200 km) was possible. Our approach is flexible and provides the potential to incorporate other sources of information which can be converted into distance or adjacency matrices such as travel times or molecular markers.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Simulation studies were carried out to understand the outcomes under the scenarios if early-implementation and removal of stay-at-home order occurred. SETTING: Population data in the United States PARTICIPANTS: Residents in the U.S., who were affected by the stay-at-home and face-masking policies MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Turning-points of the daily new cases and deaths of COVID-19, and COVID-19 time-varying reproduction numbers (Rt) in the U.S. RESULTS: The number and the proportion of U.S. residents under SAHO increased between March 19 and April 7, and plateaued at 29,0829,980 and 88.6%, respectively. The trend in COVID-19 daily cases reduced after March 23 (P<0.001) and further reduced on April 3 (P<0.001), which was associated with implementation of SAHO by 10 states on March 23, and the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions recommendation of face-masking, respectively. Similar turning points were identified in the trends of daily deaths with a lag time. The estimates of Rt based on the 3 reported mean serial-intervals of COVID-19 all started to decline on March 19, when SAHO was first implemented in the U.S. and declined faster after March 23. After a short plateau, Rt continued to decline after April 3 and fell below/around 1.0 on April 13. CONCLUSIONS: There were 2 turning points of COVID-19 daily new cases or deaths in the U.S., which appeared to associate with implementation of SAHO and the CDC face-masking recommendation. Simulation on early-implementation and removal of SAHO reveals considerable impact on COVID-19 daily new cases and deaths.

Methods: We developed a stochastic transmission model, parameterised to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. We used the model to quantify the potential effectiveness of contact tracing and isolation of cases at controlling a 2019 nCoV-like pathogen. We considered scenarios that varied in: the number of initial cases; the basic reproduction number R0; the delay from symptom onset to isolation; the probability contacts were traced; the proportion of transmission that occurred before symptom onset, and the proportion of subclinical infections. We assumed isolation prevented all further transmission in the model. Outbreaks were deemed controlled if transmission ended within 12 weeks or before 5000 cases in total. We measured the success of controlling outbreaks using isolation and contact tracing, and quantified the weekly maximum number of cases traced to measure feasibility of public health effort. Findings: While simulated outbreaks starting with only 5 initial cases, R0 of 1.5 and little transmission before symptom onset could be controlled even with low contact tracing probability, the prospects of controlling an outbreak dramatically dropped with the number of initial cases, with higher R0, and with more transmission before symptom onset. Across different initial numbers of cases, the majority of scenarios with an R0 of 1.5 were controllable with under 50% of contacts successfully traced. For R0 of 2.5 and 3.5, more than 70% and 90% of contacts respectively had to be traced to control the majority of outbreaks. The delay between symptom onset and isolation played the largest role in determining whether an outbreak was controllable for lower values of R0. For higher values of R0 and a large initial number of cases, contact tracing and isolation was only potentially feasible when less than 1% of transmission occurred before symptom onset. Interpretation: We found that in most scenarios contact tracing and case isolation alone is unlikely to control a new outbreak of 2019-nCov within three months. The probability of control decreases with longer delays from symptom onset to isolation, fewer cases ascertained by contact tracing, and increasing transmission before symptoms. This model can be modified to reflect updated transmission characteristics and more specific definitions of outbreak control to assess the potential success of local response efforts.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Objective estimation of the confidence level that an outbreak is over is important to reduce the risk of postdeclaration flare-ups. We developed a simulation-based model with which to quantify that confidence and tested it on simulated Ebola virus disease data. We found that these confidence estimates were most sensitive to the instantaneous reproduction number, the reporting rate, and the time between the symptom onset and death or recovery of the last detected case. For Ebola virus disease, our results suggested that the current World Health Organization criterion of 42 days since the recovery or death of the last detected case is too short and too sensitive to underreporting. Therefore, we suggest a shift to a preliminary end-of-outbreak declaration after 63 days from the symptom onset day of the last detected case. This preliminary declaration should still be followed by 90 days of enhanced surveillance to capture potential flare-ups of cases, after which the official end of the outbreak can be declared. This sequence corresponds to more than 95% confidence that an outbreak is over in most of the scenarios examined.

The study setting is a hypothetical college campus of 5,000 students and 455 faculty members, with 11 undetected, asymptotic SARS-CoV-2 infections at the start of an 80-day semester. For sensitivity analysis, we vary the screening frequency, daily vaccination rate, initial vaccination coverage, and screening and vaccination compliance; and consider three scenarios that represent low/medium/high transmission rates and test efficacy. Model parameters come from publicly available or published sources. Results. With low initial vaccination coverage, even aggressive vaccination and screening result in a high number of infections: 1,024/2,040 (1,532/1,773) with routine daily (every other day) screening of the unvaccinated; 275/895 with daily screening extended to the newly vaccinated in base- and worst-case scenarios, with reproduction numbers 4.75 and 6.75, respectively, representative of COVID-19 Delta variant. With the emergence of the Omicron variant, the reproduction number may increase and/or effective vaccine coverage may decrease if a booster shot is needed to maximize vaccine efficacy. Conclusion. Integrated vaccination and routine screening can allow for a safe opening of a college when initial vaccination coverage is sufficiently high. The interventions need to be customized considering the initial vaccination coverage, estimated compliance, screening and vaccination capacity, disease transmission and adverse outcome rates, and the number of infections/peak hospitalizations the college is willing to tolerate.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Several aspects cause regional heterogeneity in disease spread. Individual behaviour, mobility, viral variants and transmission vary locally, temporally and with the season, and interventions and vaccination are often implemented regionally. Therefore, we developed a new regional changepoint stochastic SEIR metapopulation model. The model is informed by real-time mobility estimates from mobile phone data, laboratory-confirmed cases, and hospitalisation incidence. To estimate locally and time-varying transmissibility, case detection probabilities, and missed imported cases, we present a new sequential Approximate Bayesian Computation method allowing inference in useful time, despite the high parametric dimension. We test our approach on Norway and find that three-week-ahead predictions are precise and well-calibrated, suitable for real-time surveillance. By comparing the reproduction number before and after lockdown, we find a national transmissibility reduction of 85% (95% CI 78%-89%). The estimated effect varied regionally and was larger for the most populated regions than in the national average.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatiotemporal mechanistic framework to integrate individual surveillance data with geolocation data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We analyze reported cases, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the state of Georgia. First, our results show that the reproductive number reduced to below one in about 2 wk after the shelter-in-place order. Superspreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in rural areas and an increasing importance toward later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases were directly responsible for 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected nonelderly cases (<60 y) may be 2.78 [2.10, 4.22] times more infectious than the elderly, and the former tend to be the main driver of superspreading. Our results improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectiousness and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of superspreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

This work uses mathematical modelling to simulate the levels of COVID-19 in North East London (NEL) and inform the level of social distancing necessary to protect the public and the healthcare demand from future COVID-19 waves. We used a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model describing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in NEL, calibrated to data on hospitalised patients with confirmed COVID-19, hospital discharges and in-hospital deaths in NEL during the first epidemic wave. To account for the uncertainty in both the infectiousness period and the proportion of symptomatic infection, we simulated nine scenarios for different combinations of infectiousness period (1, 3 and 5 days) and proportion of symptomatic infection (70%, 50% and 25% of all infections). Across all scenarios, the calibrated model was used to assess the risk of occurrence and predict the strength and timing of a second COVID-19 wave under varying levels of daily contact rate from July 04, 2020. Specifically, the daily contact rate required to suppress the epidemic and prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 cases, and the daily contact rate required to stay within the acute bed capacity of the NEL system without any additional intervention measures after July 2020, were determined across the nine different scenarios. Our results caution against a full relaxing of the lockdown later in 2020, predicting that a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of social contact from July 04, 2020, would induce a second wave up to eight times the original wave. With different levels of ongoing social distancing, future resurgence can be avoided, or the strength of the resurgence can be mitigated. Keeping the daily contact rate lower than 5 or 6, depending on scenarios, can prevent an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, could keep the effective reproduction number Re below 1 and a secondary COVID-19 wave may be avoided in NEL. A daily contact rate between 6 and 7, across scenarios, is likely to increase Re above 1 and result in a secondary COVID-19 wave with significantly increased COVID-19 cases and associated deaths, but with demand for hospital-based care remaining within the bed capacity of the NEL health and care system. In contrast, an increase in daily contact rate above 8 to 9, depending on scenarios, will likely exceed the acute bed capacity in NEL and may potentially require additional lockdowns. This scenario is associated with significantly increased COVID-19 cases and deaths, and acute COVID-19 care demand is likely to require significant scaling down of the usual operation of the health and care system and should be avoided. Our findings suggest that to avoid future COVID-19 waves and to stay within the acute bed capacity of the NEL health and care system, maintaining social distancing in NEL is advised with a view to limiting the average number of social interactions in the population. Increasing the level of social interaction beyond the limits described in this work could result in future COVID-19 waves that will likely exceed the acute bed capacity in the system, and depending on the strength of the resurgence may require additional lockdown measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Much about this outbreak is still unknown. At this early stage of the epidemic, it is important to investigate alternative sources of information to understand its dynamics and spread. With updated real time domestic traffic, this study aims to integrate recent evidence of international evacuees extracted from Wuhan between Jan. 29 and Feb. 2, 2020 to infer the dynamics of the COVD-19 outbreak in Wuhan. In addition, a modified SEIR model was used to evaluate the empirical support for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. Based on the data examined, this study found little evidence for the presence of asymptomatic transmissions. However, it is still too early to rule out its presence conclusively due to sample size and other limitations. The updated basic reproductive number was found to be 2.12 on average with a 95% credible interval of [2.04, 2.18]. It is smaller than previous estimates probably because the new estimate factors in the social and non-pharmaceutical mitigation implemented in Wuhan through the evacuee dataset. Detailed predictions of infected individuals exported both domestically and internationally were produced. The estimated case confirmation rate has been low but has increased steadily to 23.37% on average. The findings of this study depend on the validity of the underlying assumptions, and continuing work is needed, especially in monitoring the current infection status of Wuhan residents.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The parameter values of these ODE models are typically unknown and need to be estimated based on accessible data. In order to describe realistic pandemic scenarios with strongly varying situations, these model parameters need to be assumed as time-dependent. While parameter estimation for the typical case of time-constant parameters does not pose larger issues, the determination of time-dependent parameters, e.g.~the transition rates of compartmental models, remains notoriously difficult, in particular since the function class of these time-dependent parameters is unknown. In this work, we present a novel method which utilizes the Augmented Kalman Smoother in combination with an Expectation-Maximization algorithm to simultaneously estimate all time-dependent parameters in an SIRD compartmental model. This approach only requires incidence data, but no prior knowledge on model parameters or any further assumptions on the function class of the time-dependencies. In contrast to other approaches for the estimation of the time-dependent reproduction number, no assumptions on the parameterization of the serial interval distribution are required. With this method, we are able to adequately describe COVID-19 data in Germany and to give non-parametric model-based time course estimates for the effective reproduction number.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Our model dynamics is expressed by a single prognostic variable in an integro-differential equation. All unknown parameters are described with a single, timedependent variable {kappa}(t). We show that our model has similarities to classic compartmental models, such as SIR, and that the variable {kappa}(t) can be interpreted as the effective reproduction number Reff. The advantages of our approach are the simplicity of having only one equation, the numerical stability due to an integral formulation and the reliability because the model is formulated with the most trustable statistical data variable: the number of cumulative diagnosed positive cases of COVID-19. Once this dynamic variable is calculated, other non-dynamic variables, such as the number of heavy cases (hospital beds), the number of intensive-care cases (ICUs) and the fatalities, can be derived from it using a similarly stable, integral approach. The formulation with a single equation allows us to calculate from real data the values of the effective reproduction number, which can then be fitted. The extrapolated values of {kappa} can be used in the model to make a reliable forecasts, though under the assumption that measures for reducing infections are maintained. We have applied our model to more than 15 countries and results are available via a web-based platform. In this paper we focus on the data for two exemplary countries, Italy and Germany, and show that the model is capable of reproducing the course of the epidemic in the past and forecasting its course for a period of two to three weeks with a reasonable numerical stability.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Based on the different control measures, we divided the transmission process of COVID-19 into three stages. An SEIHR model was established to describe the transmission dynamics and was applied to fit the published data on the confirmed cases of Wuhan city from December 31, 2019 to March 25, 2020 to deduce the time when the first patient with COVID-19 appeared. The basic reproduction number was estimated in the first stage to demonstrate the number of secondary infectious cases generated by an average infectious case in the absence of policy intervention. The effective reproduction numbers in second and third stages were estimated to evaluate the effects of the two strict control measures. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the reproduction number according to model parameters was executed to demonstrate the effect of the control measures for containing the spread of COVID-19. Finally, the numerical calculation method was applied to investigate the influence of the different control measures on the spread of COVID-19. The results indicated that following the strict quarantine rule was very effective, and reducing the effective contact rates and improving the diagnosis rate were crucial in reducing the effective reproduction number, and taking control measures as soon as possible can effectively contain a larger outbreak of COVID-19.

METHODS: A total of 26 households with 39 family clusters between January, 2020 and February, 2021 in Taiwan were enrolled for analysis. The Becker's chain binomial model was used to analyze the probabilities of being infected and escaping from SARS-COV-2 before and after January 1st, 2021, which were further converted to estimating basic reproductive numbers in the absence of NPIs. The likelihood of leading to the subsequent community-acquired outbreak given NPIs was further assessed. RESULTS: The secondary attack rate was 46.2%. Given the saturated Greenwood model selected as the best fitted model, the probability of being infected and escaping from COVID-19 within household was estimated as 44.4% (95% CI: 5.0%-53.7%) and 55.7% (95% CI: 46.3%-65.0%), respectively. In the second period of early 2021, the infected probability was increased to 58.3% (95% CI: 12.7%-90.0%) and the escape probability was lowered to 41.7% (95% CI: 0.0%-86.9%). The corresponding basic reproductive numbers (R0) increased from 4.29 in the first period to 6.73 in the second period without NPIs. However, none of subsequent community-acquired outbreak was noted in Taiwan given very effective NPIs in both periods. CONCLUSION: The proposed method and results are useful for designing household-specific containment measures and NPIs to stamp out a large-scale community-acquired outbreak as demonstrated in Taiwan.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In order to determine the most sensitive parameters that are responsible for disease transmission with respect to the basic reproduction number and those responsible for disease prevalence with respect to the endemic equilibrium, the sensitivity analysis was established and it was confirmed that the influx rate of people into the infected population and total abstinence from all risk practices and endemic areas are some of the most sensitive parameters for disease spread and disease eradication, respectively.

We propose a SUIHR model, which represents an extension to the discrete time SIR models. The model focuses on studying the spreading of virus predominantly by asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients. Imported risk and (1-tier) contact tracing are both built into the model. Under plausible parameter assumptions, we seek sustainable border control policies, in combination with sufficient internal measures, which allow entities to confine the virus without the need to revert back to more restrictive life styles or to rely on herd immunity. When the base reproduction number of COVID-19 exceeds 2.5, even 100% effective contact tracing alone is not enough to contain the spreading. For an entity that has completely eliminated the virus domestically, and resumes \"normal\", very strict pre-departure screening and test and isolation upon arrival combined with effective contact tracing can only delay another outbreak by 6 months.

The four base interventions modelled were school closures, physical distancing, shielding of people aged 70 years or older, and self-isolation of symptomatic cases. We also modelled the combination of these interventions, as well as a programme of intensive interventions with phased lockdown-type restrictions that substantially limited contacts outside of the home for repeated periods. We simulated different triggers for the introduction of interventions, and estimated the impact of varying adherence to interventions across counties. For each scenario, we projected estimated new cases over time, patients requiring inpatient and critical care (ie, admission to the intensive care units [ICU]) treatment, and deaths, and compared the effect of each intervention on the basic reproduction number, R0.

In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic time lag between infection and death. In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al 2020, Report #13, Imperial College London] to include (a) population saturation effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more balanced prior on intervention effects and (d) partial pooling of the lockdown intervention covariate.

Due to limited availability of testing, only a non-random subset of the population can get tested. Hence, the reported test counts are subject to a large degree of selection bias. We consider an extension of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed (SEIR) model under both selection bias and misclassification. We derive closed form expression for the basic reproduction number under such data anomalies using the next generation matrix method. We conduct extensive simulation studies to quantify the effect of misclassification and selection on the resultant estimation and prediction of future case counts. Finally we apply the methods to reported case-death-recovery count data from India, a nation with more than 5 million cases reported over the last seven months. We show that correcting for misclassification and selection can lead to more accurate prediction of case-counts (and death counts) using the observed data as a beta tester.

Understanding the epidemiology of COVID-19 at a local level is becoming increasingly important to guide measures to control the pandemic. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to estimate the serial interval and basic reproduction number (R(0)) to understand the transmission dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak at a district level. We used standard mathematical modeling approaches to assess the utility of these factors in determining the effectiveness of COVID-19 responses and projecting the size of the epidemic. METHODS: Contact tracing of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 was performed to obtain the serial intervals. The median and 95th percentile values of the SARS-CoV-2 serial interval were obtained from the best fits with the weibull, log-normal, log-logistic, gamma, and generalized gamma distributions. Aggregate and instantaneous R(0) values were derived with different methods using the EarlyR and EpiEstim packages in R software. RESULTS: The median and 95th percentile values of the serial interval were 5.23 days (95% CI 4.72-5.79) and 13.20 days (95% CI 10.90-18.18), respectively. R(0) during the first 30 days of the outbreak was 1.62 (95% CI 1.07-2.17), which subsequently decreased to 1.15 (95% CI 1.09-1.21). The peak instantaneous R(0) values obtained using a Poisson process developed by Jombert et al were 6.53 (95% CI 2.12-13.38) and 3.43 (95% CI 1.71-5.74) for sliding time windows of 7 and 14 days, respectively. The peak R(0) values obtained using the method by Wallinga and Teunis were 2.96 (95% CI 2.52-3.36) and 2.92 (95% CI 2.65-3.22) for sliding time windows of 7 and 14 days, respectively. R(0) values of 1.21 (95% CI 1.09-1.34) and 1.12 (95% CI 1.03-1.21) for the 7- and 14-day sliding time windows, respectively, were obtained on July 6, 2020, using method by Jombert et al. Using the method by Wallinga and Teunis, values of 0.32 (95% CI 0.27-0.36) and 0.61 (95% CI 0.58-0.63) were obtained for the 7- and 14-day sliding time windows, respectively. The projection of cases over the next month was 2131 (95% CI 1799-2462). Reductions of transmission by 25% and 50% corresponding to reasonable and aggressive control measures could lead to 58.7% and 84.0% reductions in epidemic size, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The projected transmission reductions indicate that strengthening control measures could lead to proportionate reductions of the size of the COVID-19 epidemic. Time-dependent instantaneous R(0) estimation based on the process by Jombart et al was found to be better suited for guiding COVID-19 response at the district level than overall R(0) or instantaneous R(0) estimation by the Wallinga and Teunis method.

                "prompt": "The spatial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in China under the prevention and control measures at the early outbreak\nBACKGROUND: Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was firstly reported in Wuhan City, China in December 2019, Novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) that is caused by SARS-CoV-2 is predominantly spread from person-to-person on worldwide scales. Now, COVID-19 is a non-traditional and major public health issue the world is facing, and the outbreak is a global pandemic. The strict prevention and control measures have mitigated the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and shown positive changes with important progress in China. But prevention and control tasks remain arduous for the world. The objective of this study is to discuss the difference of spatial transmission characteristics of COVID-19 in China at the early outbreak stage with resolute efforts. Simultaneously, the COVID-19 trend of China at the early time was described from the statistical perspective using a mathematical model to evaluate the effectiveness of the prevention and control measures. METHODS: In this study, the accumulated number of confirmed cases publicly reported by the National Health Committee of the People\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s Republic of China (CNHC) from January 20 to February 11, 2020, were grouped into three partly overlapping regions: Chinese mainland including Hubei province, Hubei province alone, and the other 30 provincial-level regions on Chinese mainland excluding Hubei province, respectively. A generalized-growth model (GGM) was used to estimate the basic reproduction number to evaluate the transmissibility in different spatial locations. The prevention and control of COVID-19 in the early stage were analyzed based on the number of new cases of confirmed infections daily reported. RESULTS: Results indicated that the accumulated number of confirmed cases reported from January 20 to February 11, 2020, is well described by the GGM model with a larger correlation coefficient than 0.99. When the accumulated number of confirmed cases is well fitted by an exponential function, the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 of the 31 provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland, Hubei province, and the other 30 provincial-level regions on the Chinese mainland excluding Hubei province, is 2.68, 6.46 and 2.18, respectively. The consecutive decline of the new confirmed cases indicated that the prevention and control measures taken by the Chinese government have contained the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in a short period. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated basic reproduction number thorough GGM model can reflect the spatial difference of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in China at the early stage. The strict prevention and control measures of SARS-CoV-2 taken at the early outbreak can effectively reduce the new confirmed cases outside Hubei and have mitigated the spread and yielded positive results since February 2, 2020.

DESIGN: Independent calculations using the CovidSim code, which implements Imperial College London's individual based model, with data available in March 2020 applied to the coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) epidemic. SETTING: Simulations considering the spread of covid-19 in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. POPULATION: About 70 million simulated people matched as closely as possible to actual UK demographics, geography, and social behaviours. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Replication of summary data on the covid-19 epidemic reported to the UK government Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), and a detailed study of unpublished results, especially the effect of school closures. RESULTS: The CovidSim model would have produced a good forecast of the subsequent data if initialised with a reproduction number of about 3.5 for covid-19. The model predicted that school closures and isolation of younger people would increase the total number of deaths, albeit postponed to a second and subsequent waves. The findings of this study suggest that prompt interventions were shown to be highly effective at reducing peak demand for intensive care unit (ICU) beds but also prolong the epidemic, in some cases resulting in more deaths long term. This happens because covid-19 related mortality is highly skewed towards older age groups. In the absence of an effective vaccination programme, none of the proposed mitigation strategies in the UK would reduce the predicted total number of deaths below 200 000. CONCLUSIONS: It was predicted in March 2020 that in response to covid-19 a broad lockdown, as opposed to a focus on shielding the most vulnerable members of society, would reduce immediate demand for ICU beds at the cost of more deaths long term. The optimal strategy for saving lives in a covid-19 epidemic is different from that anticipated for an influenza epidemic with a different mortality age profile.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In this paper, the SEIR model is used to fit the number of confirmed cases in each province in China, and the reduction rate of the basic reproduction number is used to measure the actual score of the control effect of COVID-19. The potential capacity of prevention and control of epidemics, in theory, is constructed, and we use the difference between theoretical ability and actual score to measure the ability of governance of public health. We found that there were significant differences between actual effect and theoretical ability in various regions, and governance capabilities were an important reason leading to this difference, which was not consistent with the level of economic development. The balance of multiple objectives, the guiding ideology of emphasizing medical treatment over prevention, the fragmentation of the public health system, and the insufficiency of prevention and control ability in primary public health systems seriously affected the government's ability to respond to public health emergencies.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, it can also lead to undesirable outcomes if mass vaccination results in increased transmission effective contacts and relaxation of other public health interventions due to the perceived immunity from the vaccine. Methods: : We designed a mathematical model of COVID-19 transmission dynamics that takes into consideration the epidemiological status, public health intervention status (quarantined/isolated), immunity status of the population, and the strain variations. Comparing the control reproduction numbers and the final epidemic sizes (attack rate) in the cases with and without vaccination, we quantified some key factors determining when vaccination in the population is beneficial for preventing and controlling future outbreaks. Results: : Our analyses predicted that there is a critical (minimal) vaccine efficacy rate (or a critical quarantine rate) below which the control reproduction number with vaccination is higher than that without vaccination, and the final attack rate in the population is also higher with the vaccination. We also predicted the worst case scenario occurs when a high vaccine coverage is achieved for a vaccine with lower efficacy rate and when the vaccines increase the transmission efficient contacts. Conclusions: : The analyses show that an immunization program with a vaccine efficacy rate below the predicted critical values will not be as effective as simply investing in the contact tracing/quarantine/isolation implementation. We reached similar conclusions by considering the final epidemic size (or attack rates). This research then highlights the importance of monitoring the impact on transmissibility and vaccine efficacy of emerging strains.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Its value determines both the dynamics of the incidence and the level of anti-epidemic measures. Therefore, it is desirable to have a fairly accurate method for assessing R-0 for each day. Aim: Develop a methodology for determining the R-0 value for COVID-19, taking into account a reasonably rapid and significant change in its value over time. Methods: a method for calculating reproduction number R-0 was proposed for assessing COVID-19 R-0, taking into account the change in the contagiousness of the infected people during the infectious process. Results and Discussion: In Russia in June-August 2020, the reproduction rate was slightly less 1, but in September R-0 began to grow, exceeded 1, which was caused a noticeable increase in the incidence. During June in Brazil, R-0 stabilized at a value of 1. The activity of transmission of the pathogen is influenced by seasonal changes in the reproduction rate R-0 and the level of community immune status. Based on the assessment of the dynamics of the incidence of other pneumonia, it was found that the change of R-0 during the year is about 10%, with a minimum in summer. Conclusions: while maintaining the current activity of anti-epidemic measures due to seasonal factors of the activity of the transmission mechanism and accumulation of the immune individuals in the coming months, the situation in the Russian Federation will worsen with an increase in the incidence doubled within six months, and in Brazil in six months - improve with a decrease in the incidence ten times. However, the dynamics of the incidence will be determined primarily by the work of the administration and health authorities and the conscientiousness of citizens.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

However, most cases reported in February 2020 were local infections with unknown source, indicating local community transmissions. This study aimed to report the clinical, epidemiological and phylogenomic characteristics of the local cases of COVID-19 in our community. Methods: We extracted the demographic, clinical and epidemiological data from 50 COVID-19 patients, who accounted for 53.8% of the cases in Hong Kong by the end of February 2020. We used both Nanopore and Illumina platforms to perform whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from these patients. Phylogenetic relatedness among these local cases and their placement in the global phylogeny were examined. The evolutionary rate and divergence time of transmission were also determined. Findings: Of these 50 patients, only three (6.0%) had visited Wuhan while 43 (86.0%) did not have recent travel records. The average interval from symptom onset to hospital admission was 8.5 days. The most common signs and symptoms on admission were cough (74.0%) and fever (58.0%). Radiographic abnormality was found in 46 (92.0%) patients. Three (6.0%) patients required ICU admission. Phylogenetic analysis concurred with epidemiological investigation that 42 (84.0%) cases could be grouped into six transmission clusters. Forty-four (88.0%) cases harboured a common mutation Orf3a G251V. Global phylogeny of SARS-CoV-2 revealed that most (88.0%) cases in Hong Kong were clustered in two subclades with the strains from other countries. The estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of COVID-2019 outbreak in Hong Kong was December 24, 2019 with an evolutionary rate of 3.04x10-3 substitutions per site per year.

METHODS: PubMed, Google Scholar, medRxiv, bioRxiv, arXiv, and SSRN were searched for papers regarding the estimation of four epidemiological parameters of COVID-19: the basic reproduction number, incubation period, infectious period, and case-fatality-rate. Distributions of parameters and timeliness of preprints and peer-reviewed papers were compared. Four parameters in two groups were synthesized by bootstrapping, and their validities were evaluated by simulated cumulative cases of the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered-dead-cumulative (SEIRDC) model. RESULTS: A total of 106 papers were included for analysis. The distributions of four parameters in two literature groups were close, and the timeliness of preprints was better. Synthesized estimates of the basic reproduction number (3.18, 95% CI 2.85-3.53), incubation period (5.44 days, 95% CI 4.98-5.99), infectious period (6.25 days, 95% CI 5.09-7.51), and case-fatality-rate (4.51%, 95% CI 3.41%-6.29%) were obtained.

Here we propose an integrative maximum likelihood analysis of both cluster data in the ME and importations in a set of European countries to assess the transmission scenario and incidence of sporadic infections. Our approach is based on a spatial-transmission model integrating mobility data worldwide and allows for variations in the zoonotic/environmental transmission and under-ascertainment. Maximum likelihood estimates for the ME, considering outbreak data up to 31 August 2013, indicate the occurrence of a subcritical epidemic with a reproductive number R of 0.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.30-0.77) associated with a daily rate of sporadic introductions psp of 0.28 (95% CI: 0.12-0.85). Infections in the ME appear to be mainly dominated by zoonotic/environmental transmissions, with possible under-ascertainment (ratio of estimated to observed (0.116) sporadic cases equal to 2.41, 95% CI: 1.03-7.32). No time evolution of the situation emerges. Analyses of flight passenger data from ME countries indicate areas at high risk of importation. While dismissing an immediate threat for global health security, this analysis provides a baseline scenario for future reference and updates, suggests reinforced surveillance to limit under-ascertainment, and calls for alertness in high importation risk areas worldwide.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Dynamics and numerical approximations for the proposed fractional-order model are studied. Firstly, positivity and boundedness of the model are established. Secondly, the basic reproduction number of the model is calculated by using the next generation matrix approach. Then, asymptotic stability of the model is investigated.

In Sao Paulo State, the first case of CoViD-19 was confirmed on 26 February, the first death due to CoViD-19 was registered on 16 March, on 24 March the Sao Paulo State authorities implemented the isolation of persons in non-essential activities, which is programmed to end on June 1. The deterministic model used the data collected in Sao Paulo State to estimate the model parameters to describe the current epidemiological status in the State under isolation. We concluded that the proportion in isolation influenced the number of new cases in around 9 days ahead. We evaluate the suitability of lockdown in Sao Paulo State and concluded that this extreme measure should be efficient if lower transmission is occurring among isolated persons. Nevertheless, the isolated persons must be released one day. Based on this model, we studied the potential epidemiological scenarios of release by varying the release proportions of young and elder persons. We evaluated three releases divided in equal proportions elapsed 14 days between releases, and three strategies: the first release occurring on June 1, 15 and 23. We concluded that these three strategies are equivalent (little difference) in reducing the number of hospitalization due to severe CoViD-19 and deaths, due to presenting the effective reproduction number near one. However, if protection actions as using face mask and hygiene (washing hands, for instance) could be massively disseminated in the population, we concluded there health care system may not collapse.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

The analysis of transmission dynamics is crucial to determine whether mitigation or suppression measures reduce the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This study sought to estimate the basic (R(0)) and time-varying (R(t)) reproduction number of COVID-19 and contrast the public health measures for ten South American countries. METHODS. Data was obtained from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. Country-specific R(0) values during the first two weeks of the outbreak and R(t) values after 90 days were estimated. RESULTS. Countries used a combination of isolation, physical distancing, quarantine, and community-wide containment measures to staunch the spread of COVID-19 at different points in time. R(0) ranged from 1.52 (95% confidence interval: 1.13-1.99) in Venezuela to 3.83 (3.04-4.75) in Chile, whereas R(t) after 90 days ranged from 0.71 (95% credible interval: 0.39-1.05) in Uruguay to 1.20 (1.19-1.20) in Brazil. Different R(0) and R(t) values may be related to the testing capacity of each country. CONCLUSION. R(0) in the early phase of the outbreak varied across the South American countries.

Here, we collected information of all infected cases (135 cases) between 21 January and 26 February 2020 from official public sources in Tianjin, a metropolis of China, and grouped them into 43 transmission chains with the largest chain of 45 cases and the longest chain of four generations.

As of March 31, 2020, a total of 82,631 cases of COVID-19 in China were confirmed by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China. METHODS: Three approaches, namely Poisson likelihood-based method (ML), exponential growth rate-based method (EGR) and stochastic Susceptible-Infected-Removed dynamic model-based method (SIR), were implemented to estimate the basic and controlled reproduction numbers. RESULTS: A total of 198 chains of transmission together with dates of symptoms onset and 139 dates of infections were identified among 14,829 confirmed cases outside Hubei Province as reported as of March 31, 2020. Based on this information, we found that the serial interval had an average of 4.60 days with a standard deviation of 5.55 days, the incubation period had an average of 8.00 days with a standard deviation of 4.75 days and the infectious period had an average of 13.96 days with a standard deviation of 5.20 days. The estimated controlled reproduction numbers, Rc, produced by all three methods in all analyzed regions of China are significantly smaller compared with the basic reproduction numbers R0. CONCLUSIONS: The controlled reproduction number in China is much lower than one in all regions of China by now. It fell below one within 30 days from the implementations of unprecedent containment measures, which indicates that the strong measures taken by China government was effective to contain the epidemic. Nonetheless, efforts are still needed in order to end the current epidemic as imported cases from overseas pose a high risk of a second outbreak.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: One hundred subjects were included. Nineteen index COVID-19 cases and 81 traced close contacts were screened for coronavirus 2 of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Immunoglobulin M and G against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated by rapid test. RESULTS: Thirty-four (42%) contacts in the study were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-three (67.6%) manifested less than 2 respiratory symptoms, and 5 (14.7%) remained asymptomatic. The average of positive contacts by index COVID-19 case (R0) was 4.3 and the mean of time of positive COVID-19 test at sampling time was 18.9 days.

However, if collected over country or regional scales, these metrics hide important smaller-scale, local dynamics. We examine how commonly used epidemiological metrics differ for each individual state within the United States during the initial COVID-19 outbreak. We found that the detected case number and trajectory of early detected cases differ considerably between states. We then test for correlations with testing protocols, interventions and population characteristics. We find that epidemic dynamics were most strongly associated with non-pharmaceutical government actions during the early phase of the epidemic. In particular, early social distancing restrictions, particularly on restaurant operations, was correlated with increased doubling times. Interestingly, we also found that states with little tolerance for deviance from enforced rules saw faster early epidemic growth. Together with other correlates such as population density, our results highlight the different factors involved in the heterogeneity in the early spread of COVID-19 throughout the United States. Although individual states are clearly not independent, they can serve as small, natural experiments in how different demographic patterns and government responses can impact the course of an epidemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

METHODS: A scoping review, compiling both peer-reviewed and grey literature, focusing on substance use and COVID-19 was conducted on September 15, 2020 and again in April 15, 2021 to capture any new studies. Three bibliographic databases (Web of Science Core Collection, Embase, PubMed) and several preprint servers (EuropePMC, bioRxiv, medRxiv, F1000, PeerJ Preprints, PsyArXiv, Research Square) were searched. We included English language original studies only. RESULTS: Of 1564 articles screened in the abstract and title screening phase, we included 111 research studies (peer-reviewed: 98, grey literature: 13) that met inclusion criteria. There was limited research on substance use other than those involving tobacco or alcohol. We noted that individuals engaging in substance use had increased risk for COVID-19 severity, and Black Americans with COVID-19 and who engaged in substance use had worse outcomes than white Americans. There were issues with treatment provision earlier in the pandemic, but increased use of telehealth as the pandemic progressed. COVID-19 anxiety was associated with increased substance use. CONCLUSIONS: Our scoping review of studies to date during COVID-19 uncovered notable research gaps namely the need for research efforts on vaccines, COVID-19 concerns such as anxiety and worry, and low- to middle-income countries (LMICs) and under-researched topics within substance use, and to explore the use of qualitative techniques and interventions where appropriate.

METHODS: Histology and RNA-Seq were performed on bones obtained from children. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment assay, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) were used to identify dysregulated pathways. Reverse-phase protein array, Western blot, and IHC were performed to evaluate protein expression. A phase I study of fresolimumab, a TGF-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2 neutralizing antibody, was conducted in 8 adults with OI. Safety and effects on bone remodeling markers and lumbar spine areal bone mineral density (LS aBMD) were assessed.

We have divided the COVID-19 pandemic in Iran into two waves, Wave I, from February 20, 2020 to May 4, 2020, and Wave II from May 5, 2020, to the present. Two statistical methods, i.e., Pearson correlation coefficient (R) and the coefficient of determination (R2), are used to assess the accuracy of studied models. Results for Wave I Logistic, Ratkowsky, and SIRD models have correctly fitted COVID-19 data in Iran. SIRD model has fitted the first peak of infection very closely on April 6, 2020, with 34,447 cases (The actual peak day was April 7, 2020, with 30,387 active infected patients) with the re-production number R0=3.95. Results of Wave II indicate that the SIRD model has precisely fitted with the second peak of infection, which was on June 20, 2020, with 19,088 active infected cases compared with the actual peak day on June 21, 2020, with 17,644 cases. In Wave II, the re-production number R0=1.45 is reduced, indicating a lower transmission rate. We aimed to provide even a rough project future trends of COVID-19 in Iran for NPI decisions. Between 180,000 to 250,000 infected cases and a death toll of between 6,000 to 65,000 cases are expected in Wave II of COVID-19 in Iran. There is currently no analytical method to project more waves of COVID-19 beyond Wave II.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Therefore, in a bid to answer a burning question of reinfection in the recovered class, the model equations which exhibits the disease-free equilibrium (E_0 ) state for COVID-19 coronavirus was developed in this study and was discovered to both exist as well as satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability with a basic reproductive number R_0=0 for and endemic situation. Hence, there is a chance of no secondary reinfections from the recovered population as the rate of incidence of the recovered population vanishes, that is, B=0. Furthermore, numerical simulations were carried to complement the analytical results in investigating the effect of the implementation of quarantine and observatory procedures has on the projection of the further spread of the virus globally. Result shows that the proportion of infected population in the absence of curative vaccination will continue to grow globally meanwhile the recovery rate will continue slowly which therefore means that the ratio of infection to recovery rate will determine the death rate that is recorded globally and most significant for this study is the rate of reinfection by the recovered population which will decline to zero over time as the virus is cleared clinically from the system of the recovered class.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

On 26 March 2020, a total of 17166 cases were already reported, with 2090 deaths. Globally a R0 index of 2-3 has been reported. We aimed to build an experimental mathematical model that help to analyze the early characteristics of Madrid Covid-19 disese outbreak and to explore the actual R0 index on Madrid Covid-19 outbreak. Material and Methods: A simulated mathematical model was built, based on a SIR epidemiological model and the reported characteristics of Wuhan Covid-19 disease outbreak. Monte Carlo simulations were further done to estimate the R0 value over time in the Madrid Covid-19 disease outbreak. Results: Mean estimated R0 value along the early period is of 2.22 (+/- 1.21 SD). A significant increase of 0.093 (+/- 0.037, p=0.025) in R0 value each day of outbreak is found. Conclussions: Our proposed Mathematical Simulation model may be useful to evaluate early characteristics of this outbreak. The present work is the first reported estimation of R0 value in the Spanish Madrid Covid-19 outbreak, with similar results to the previous reported in the Wuhan outbreak, although it may suggest a slightly increase on R0 along time.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

Due to the dynamics of COVID-19 where many infected people are not showing symptoms or showing mild symptoms, and where different countries are employing different testing strategies, it is quite difficult to calculate the R, while the pandemic is still widespread. This paper presents a probabilistic methodology to evaluate the effective reproduction number by considering only the daily death statistics of a given country. The methodology utilizes a linearly constrained Quadratic Programming scheme to estimate the daily new infection cases from the daily death statistics, based on the probability distribution of delays associated with symptom onset and to reporting a death. The proposed methodology is validated in-silico by simulating an infectious disease through a Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model. The results suggest that with a reasonable estimate of distribution of delay to death from the onset of symptoms, the model can provide accurate estimates of R. The proposed method is then used to estimate the R values for two countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

We have captured the effect of the immigration as two separate factors contributing in the rural compartments of the model. We have first established the positivity of the solution and the boundedness of the solution followed by the existence and uniqueness of the solution for this multi compartment model. We later went on to find out the equibria of the system and derived the reproduction number. Further we numerically depicted the local and global stability of the equilibria. Later we have done sensitivity analysis of the model parameters and identified the sensitive parameters of the system. The sensitivity analysis is followed up with the two parameter heat plots dealing with the sensitive parameters of the system. These heat plots gives us the parameter regions in which the system is stable.

Although there are outbreak reports involving mass gatherings, the contribution to overall transmission is unknown. We used data from a survey of social contact behaviour that specifically asked about contact with groups to estimate the population attributable fraction (PAF) due to groups as the relative change in the basic reproduction number when groups are prevented. Groups of 50+ individuals accounted for 0.5% of reported contact events, and we estimate that the PAF due to groups of 50+ people is 5.4% (95% confidence interval 1.4%, 11.5%). The PAF due to groups of 20+ people is 18.9% (12.7%, 25.7%) and the PAF due to groups of 10+ is 25.2% (19.4%, 31.4%). Under normal circumstances with pre-COVID-19 contact patterns, large groups of individuals have a relatively small epidemiological impact; small- and medium-sized groups between 10 and 50 people have a larger impact on an epidemic.

A key question in the study of emerging zoonoses is how the evolution of transmission efficiency interacts with heterogeneity in contact patterns in the new host species, as this interplay influences disease dynamics and prospects for control. Here we use a synergistic mixture of models and data to tease apart the evolutionary and demographic processes controlling a host-range shift in equine H3N8-derived canine influenza virus (CIV). CIV has experienced 15 years of continuous transfer among dogs in the United States, but maintains a patchy distribution, characterized by sporadic short-lived outbreaks coupled with endemic hotspots in large animal shelters. We show that CIV has a high reproductive potential in these facilities (mean R(0) = 3.9) and that these hotspots act as refugia from the sparsely connected majority of the dog population. Intriguingly, CIV has evolved a transmission efficiency that closely matches the minimum required to persist in these refugia, leaving it poised on the extinction/invasion threshold of the host contact network. Corresponding phylogenetic analyses show strong geographic clustering in three US regions, and that the effective reproductive number of the virus (R(e)) in the general dog population is close to 1.0. Our results highlight the critical role of host contact structure in CIV dynamics, and show how host contact networks could shape the evolution of pathogen transmission efficiency. Importantly, efficient control measures could eradicate the virus, in turn minimizing the risk of future sustained transmission among companion dogs that could represent a potential new axis to the human-animal interface for influenza.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",

In response, governments initiated a series of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) that led to severe economic and social impacts. The effect of these intervention measures on the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic are not well investigated within developing country settings. This study simulated the trajectories of the COVID-19 pandemic curve in Jordan between February and May and assessed the effect of Jordan's strict NPI measures on the spread of COVID-19. A modified susceptible, exposed, infected, and recovered (SEIR) epidemic model was utilized. The compartments in the proposed model categorized the Jordanian population into six deterministic compartments: suspected, exposed, infectious pre-symptomatic, infectious with mild symptoms, infectious with moderate to severe symptoms, and recovered. The GLEAMviz client simulator was used to run the simulation model. Epidemic curves were plotted for estimated COVID-19 cases in the simulation model, and compared against the reported cases. The simulation model estimated the highest number of total daily new COVID-19 cases, in the pre-symptomatic compartmental state, to be 65 cases, with an epidemic curve growing to its peak in 49 days and terminating in a duration of 83 days, and a total simulated cumulative case count of 1048 cases. The curve representing the number of actual reported cases in Jordan showed a good pattern compatibility to that in the mild and moderate to severe compartmental states. The reproduction number under the NPIs was reduced from 5.6 to less than one. NPIs in Jordan seem to be effective in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic and reducing the reproduction rate. Early strict intervention measures showed evidence of containing and suppressing the disease.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?",
