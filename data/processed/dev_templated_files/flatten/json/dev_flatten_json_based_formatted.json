He asked almost half of the population of Japan to reduce their personal contacts by 70\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212280%. Object: This study estimates the effectiveness of that emergency declaration. Method: We applied a simple susceptible\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122infected\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Tokyo, Japan for January 14 \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 April 21 as of April 22. We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514]. Discussion and Concussion: One must be reminded that these results reflect only those at two weeks after the emergency declaration. The reproduction number probably changed thereafter continuously.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\".

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January. From 28 January to 30 April, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 1.5014. Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy. The paper discusses further high-order interactions and other implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease transmission on a residential college campus.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Within a compartmental realization of this model, we found the disease-free and the endemic stationary states. They exist in their respective restricted regions of the le via linear stability analysis. The expression for the basic reproductive number is obtained as well. The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm. These allowed to study the effect of the quarantine measures explicitly, via changing the neighbourhood size.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17).

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors. Aggressive curative resection remains to be the optimal option for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Non-curative resection, pathological differentiation, and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/ dL were associated with dismal prognosis.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models. Studies or public health surveillance methods based on similar designs offer opportunities for further improving our understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens and their interaction with population-level immunity.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy:\n\nBACKGROUND: In the night of February 20, 2020, the first epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outside Asia was uncovered by the identification of its first patient in Lombardy region, Italy. In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve. We estimate the basic reproduction number R(0) of SARS virus is 2.87 in mainland of China, very close to the estimations in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Improved inference of time-varying reproduction numbers during infectious disease outbreaks:\n\nAccurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

We find that the number of cases in April 22 varies between 506 and 2 026 infected cases. We also focus on the reproductive number in Palestine based on population dynamics with two SEIR models. Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society.

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected.

Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0).

Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0).

Information and awareness on preventative techniques can be spread through the use of social media, which has become an increasingly utilized tool in recent years. This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available. The findings indicate that social media is an integral part in the humanitarian logistics of pandemic and emergency preparedness, and contributes to the literature by informing best practices in the response to similar disasters.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points.

Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer &#964; value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic. April 1, 2020 would be a reasonable date to lift quarantine in Hubei and Wuhan.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\".

OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

Method: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on all people with COVID-19 from the first date of admission of positive PCR patients with SARS-CoV-2 until September 21, 2020, in the area of Markazi Province in Khomein, Iran. Information on the records of definitively discharged and deceased patients due to COVID-19 (having positive PCR) was extracted from 20/2/2020 to 21/9/2020, and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19 were evaluated. The sample size was 691 people. Results: The CFR of the COVID-19 in the current study is 6.65%, and the rate of disease transmission among the sensitive population of Khomein city at the beginning of the study (March) averaged BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.75, and in the last month (September) of the study This value was reduced to BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.306. Conclusion: According to our study on Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19, showed that the prevalence of the disease was high in March, which due to lack of proper observance of health protocols, we saw this problem and in the months when people have more problems.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%).

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread:\n\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the reproductive number R(0) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00cb\u2020 2.4 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 0.2. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned. Summarizing the lessons learned could help in designing effective public responses for constraining future waves of COVID-19 worldwide.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Genomic epidemiology offers high resolution estimates of serial intervals for COVID-19:\n\nEstimating key aspects of transmission is crucial in infectious disease control. Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.14 to \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant.

What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 epidemic severity is associated with timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions:\n\nBackground: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nPlease answer a question about this article.

We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514]. Discussion and Concussion: One must be reminded that these results reflect only those at two weeks after the emergency declaration.

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January. From 28 January to 30 April, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 1.5014. Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The model has two equilibrium points when the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] ; a disease-free equilibrium [Formula: see text] and a disease endemic equilibrium [Formula: see text] . The disease-free equilibrium stage is locally and globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , we show that the endemic equilibrium state is locally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text] . We also prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution for the Atangana\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Baleanu SIR model by using a fixed-point method. Since the Atangana\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Baleanu fractional derivative gives better precise results to the derivative with exponential kernel because of having fractional order, hence, it is a generalized form of the derivative with exponential kernel. The numerical simulations are explored for various values of the fractional order. Finally, the effect of the ABC fractional-order derivative on suspected and infected individuals carefully is examined and compared with the real data.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy. The paper discusses further high-order interactions and other implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease transmission on a residential college campus.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Within a compartmental realization of this model, we found the disease-free and the endemic stationary states. They exist in their respective restricted regions of the le via linear stability analysis. The expression for the basic reproductive number is obtained as well. The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm. These allowed to study the effect of the quarantine measures explicitly, via changing the neighbourhood size. The attempt is made to match both quarantine and vaccination measures aimed on balanced solution for effective suppression of the pandemic.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The clinical disease caused by the virus was also called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11.03.2020. As of 26.03.2020, there have been 462.684 confirmed cases and 20.834 deaths globally, and these numbers are expected to increase in the coming days. The dynamics of virus spread are investigated with various models and outbreak parameters such as incubation time and basic reproduction number (R0) is tried to be illuminated. According to official numbers, as of 03.26.2020, there have also been 3629 cases and 75 deaths in Turkey. COVID-19 Guideline prepared by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey is constantly updated with additional prevention and treatment strategies.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK. Our plots are available online and constantly updated with new data to closely monitor the changes in absolute numbers.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is presented to identify and study the impact of critical model parameters on the reproduction number. A time dependent optimal treatment strategy is designed using Pontryagin\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s maximum principle to minimize the treatment cost and the infected population.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled. Worldwide preparedness and vulnerability against COVID-19 should be regarded with more care.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed. Both the SEIR-HL model and an R 0 calculator were computerized and made available to the community.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153478). Calculated mean basic reproductive number (R0) was 6.5 (Interquartile range, IQR 5.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01537.2). However, better case scenarios with different parameters led to no secondary cases. Altering parameters, especially time to hospital visit. could change the impact of a secondary outbreak. With these multiple scenarios with different parameters, healthcare professionals might be able to better prepare for this viral infection.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors. Aggressive curative resection remains to be the optimal option for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Non-curative resection, pathological differentiation, and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/ dL were associated with dismal prognosis.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models. Studies or public health surveillance methods based on similar designs offer opportunities for further improving our understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens and their interaction with population-level immunity.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Little is known about its epidemiology. We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve. We estimate the basic reproduction number R(0) of SARS virus is 2.87 in mainland of China, very close to the estimations in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

To compare the epidemic prevention ability of COVID-19 of each province in China and to evaluate the existing prevention and control capacity of each province.Methods. We established a quasi-Poisson linear mixed-effects model using the case data in cities outside Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan was underestimated in the initial period of the outbreak. Provincial surveillance and emergency response capabilities vary across the country.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

We find that the number of cases in April 22 varies between 506 and 2 026 infected cases. We also focus on the reproductive number in Palestine based on population dynamics with two SEIR models. Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1. Changes to the transmission rate (over time) would be advisable, to fall R0 below the critical threshold.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

That policy has been designated as voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC). OBJECT: This study assesses VECSC effectiveness based on predicted outcomes. METHODS: A simple susceptible\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153infected\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153recovered model was applied to data of patients with symptoms in Japan during January 14 through March 26. The respective reproduction numbers for periods before VECSC (R(0)), during VECSC (R(e)), and after VECSC (R(a)) were estimated. RESULTS: Results suggest R(0) before VECSC as 2.534 [2.449, 2.598], R(e) during VECSC as 1.077 [0.948, 1.228], and R(a) after VECSC as 4.455 [3.615, 5.255].

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dpopulation between 20\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015334 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009das having strong relationships with R(0), across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques. An implementation of the model is available online at www.ipol.im/ern.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10. The transmission rate fell after Feb 12, 2020 as a result of China\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s COVID-19 strategy of keeping society distance and the medical support from all China, but principally because of the clinical symptoms to be used for the novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) confirmation in Wuhan since Feb 12, 2020. Clinical diagnosis can quicken up NCP-confirmation such that the COVID-19 patients can be isolated without delay. So the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation is the turning point of the COVID-19 battle of Wuhan. The measure of clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation in Wuhan has delayed the growth and reduced size of the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased the peak number of the hospitalized cases by 96% in Wuhan. Our modeling also indicates that the earliest start date of COVID-19 in Wuhan may be Nov 2, 2019.\u00c3\u00af\u00c2\u00bb\u00c2\u00bf\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Internal viral dynamics and stability attributes are thoroughly investigated around stable equilibrium states to probe possible ways in reducing rapid spread by incorporating fractional-order components into epidemic systems. Furthermore, a fractional optimal problem was built and studied with three control measures to restrict the widespread of COVID-19 infections and exhibit perfect protection. It is found that by following [Formula: see text] of control strategies can eradicate the infectives.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic Reproductive number (R_0<1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure. The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This virus epidemic quickly became a public health emergency of international concern by the WHO. Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 1739.0. Total infected patients could be 913396.5 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 559099.9 by the end of period 2 (day70) in free transmission state. And at day90, total patients number is 913396.5 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 559099.9. Conclusion: COVID-19 is a novel severe respiratory disease. This will put great burden on the shoulder of healthcare workers as well as on medical hardware and supplements. Current strict control measures help to contain disease from spreading. An early detecting, reporting and fast reacting system needs to be setup to prevent future unknown infectious disease.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Social distancing is a method to minimize crowd interactions and prevent the spread of disease within groups of people. This is a common practice which has been carried out over generations to minimize the spread of virus by limiting its reproduction rate (R0) among communities. The article focuses on how social distancing has been used to deal previous pandemics globally and the issues that needs to be addressed to tackle the COVID-19 threat.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations. Finally, combining our results, we provided an effective lockdown policy to reduce future COVID-19 transmission in India.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

A lesser-known measure of virologic infectivity is the particle-to-plaque ratio (P:PFU). We suggest that comparison between the two parameters may assist in better understanding viral transmission dynamics.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Information and awareness on preventative techniques can be spread through the use of social media, which has become an increasingly utilized tool in recent years. This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available. The findings indicate that social media is an integral part in the humanitarian logistics of pandemic and emergency preparedness, and contributes to the literature by informing best practices in the response to similar disasters.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6-7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2-2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, we examined the existence and uniqueness of the solution for both extensions of these models. Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer &#964; value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases. Concurrently, the CF approach demonstrated promise for use in mild cases. Furthermore, the integer &#964; value results of both approaches were identical.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic. April 1, 2020 would be a reasonable date to lift quarantine in Hubei and Wuhan.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this study support having high targets for 2-dose measles vaccine coverage, particularly among school-aged children in the United States.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19.

Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%. CONCLUSION: Our presented modeling framework provides a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and to quantify the effect of dengue control on dengue infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

Method: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on all people with COVID-19 from the first date of admission of positive PCR patients with SARS-CoV-2 until September 21, 2020, in the area of Markazi Province in Khomein, Iran. Information on the records of definitively discharged and deceased patients due to COVID-19 (having positive PCR) was extracted from 20/2/2020 to 21/9/2020, and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19 were evaluated. The sample size was 691 people. Results: The CFR of the COVID-19 in the current study is 6.65%, and the rate of disease transmission among the sensitive population of Khomein city at the beginning of the study (March) averaged BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.75, and in the last month (September) of the study This value was reduced to BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.306. Conclusion: According to our study on Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19, showed that the prevalence of the disease was high in March, which due to lack of proper observance of health protocols, we saw this problem and in the months when people have more problems.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R(t) was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.51). INTERPRETATION: The first eight weeks following COVID-19 importation were characterised by early predominance of imported cases and relatively low mortality and transmission rates. Despite stringent lockdown measures, the second month following importation was characterised by community transmission and increasing disease burden in more populous provinces.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases. CONCLUSIONS: A general lesson for health policymakers should be that even a short lapse in public responsiveness can lead to dire consequences.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the reproductive number R(0) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00cb\u2020 2.4 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 0.2. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea. Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned. Summarizing the lessons learned could help in designing effective public responses for constraining future waves of COVID-19 worldwide.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The proposed enhanced model, which will be referred to as the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model with population migration, is inspired by the role that asymptomatic infected individuals, as well as population movements can play a crucial role in spreading the virus. In the model, the infected and the basic reproduction numbers are compared under the influence of intervention policies.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled R(o) are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed to assess health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in R(o) > 2.7 within 44 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.14 to \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this and answer the question.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514].

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death.

Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is presented to identify and study the impact of critical model parameters on the reproduction number.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled. Worldwide preparedness and vulnerability against COVID-19 should be regarded with more care.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed. Both the SEIR-HL model and an R 0 calculator were computerized and made available to the community.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

(If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "Enhancing genetic disease control by selecting for lower host infectivity and susceptibility\nInfectious diseases have a huge impact on animal health, production and welfare, and human health. Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors.

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319).

A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "Improved inference of time-varying reproduction numbers during infectious disease outbreaks\nAccurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25.

Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity.

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dpopulation between 20\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015334 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009das having strong relationships with R(0), across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations.

Information and awareness on preventative techniques can be spread through the use of social media, which has become an increasingly utilized tool in recent years. This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature.

Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%. CONCLUSION: Our presented modeling framework provides a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and to quantify the effect of dengue control on dengue infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "Estimation of basic reproduction number of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the outbreak in South Korea, 2015\nBACKGROUND: In South Korea, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in 2015. It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons).

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16).

We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses.

The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management. NIH TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: R01-194787\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "Genomic epidemiology offers high resolution estimates of serial intervals for COVID-19\nEstimating key aspects of transmission is crucial in infectious disease control. Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.14 to \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method? (If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\")", "COVID-19 epidemic severity is associated with timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions\nBackground: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?

We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514].

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January. From 28 January to 30 April, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 1.5014. Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death.

CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000).

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading.

In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319).

A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe.

Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020.

Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels.

Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent.

To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72.

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mathematical Modeling of Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 Dynamics using CF and ABC Non-Singular Fractional Derivatives\nIn this article, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 transmission dynamics were studied to examine the utility of the SEIR compartmental model, using two non-singular kernel fractional derivative operators.

METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessing health burden risk and control effect on dengue fever infection in the southern region of Taiwan\nBACKGROUND: The high prevalence of dengue in Taiwan and the consecutive large dengue outbreaks in the period 2014\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 suggest that current control interventions are suboptimal. Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%. CONCLUSION: Our presented modeling framework provides a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and to quantify the effect of dengue control on dengue infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of basic reproduction number of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the outbreak in South Korea, 2015\nBACKGROUND: In South Korea, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in 2015. It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan\nDue to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons).

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44).

After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned.

We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0.

Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses.

The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\nTry to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514].

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death.

CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000).

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing super-spreading events and age-specific infectivity of COVID-19 transmission in Georgia, USA\nAs the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact countries around the globe, refining our understanding of its transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions is imperative. In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy\nBACKGROUND: In the night of February 20, 2020, the first epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outside Asia was uncovered by the identification of its first patient in Lombardy region, Italy. In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States\nImportance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020.

Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Simulating the progression of the COVID-19 disease in Cameroon using SIR models\nThis paper analyses the evolution of COVID 19 disease in Cameroon over the period March 6 April 2020 using SIR model.

Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one.

The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West.

Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25.

Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72.

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Nursing Home Design and COVID-19: Implications for Guidelines and Regulation\nObjectives Nursing homes (NHs) are important health care and residential environments for the growing number of frail older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020.

Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days.

We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mathematical Modeling of Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 Dynamics using CF and ABC Non-Singular Fractional Derivatives\nIn this article, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 transmission dynamics were studied to examine the utility of the SEIR compartmental model, using two non-singular kernel fractional derivative operators.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%. CONCLUSION: Our presented modeling framework provides a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and to quantify the effect of dengue control on dengue infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of basic reproduction number of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the outbreak in South Korea, 2015\nBACKGROUND: In South Korea, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in 2015. It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan\nDue to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons).

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44).

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned.

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0.

Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses.

Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\nIf it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514].

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death.

The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000).

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading.

In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces.

A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe.

Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels.

Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide.

The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent.

To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72.

Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020.

We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou.

METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus.

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths.

It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui.

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories.

Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned.

We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0.

Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Linking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nAnswer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK. Our plots are available online and constantly updated with new data to closely monitor the changes in absolute numbers.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed. Both the SEIR-HL model and an R 0 calculator were computerized and made available to the community.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000).

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces.

This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe.

Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index).

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72.

A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0).

Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19.

This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case.

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui.

FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons).

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories.

Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0.

Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\nWhat is the answer?

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

Various predictions are made for the future course of the pandemic, and the contribution of the spread of the virus in Africa and seasonal changes on this issue has been investigated.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Analysing secondary infections of coronavirus disease 2019 across the geopolitical zones of Nigeria using estimated time dependent reproduction number\nTime dependent reproduction number (TD - R0) is a measure of secondary infections or transmissibility of a disease useful in monitoring changes in the rate of infection and assessing policies put in place to control the spread of a.2, disease. In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases and estimates of the reproductive numbers 1 month into the epidemic, Italy, 28 January to 31 March 2020\nBACKGROUND: On 20 February 2020, a locally acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case was detected in Lombardy, Italy. This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000).

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading.

In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces.

Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data.

Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia. Little is known about its epidemiology. We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve.

To compare the epidemic prevention ability of COVID-19 of each province in China and to evaluate the existing prevention and control capacity of each province.Methods. We established a quasi-Poisson linear mixed-effects model using the case data in cities outside Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan was underestimated in the initial period of the outbreak. Provincial surveillance and emergency response capabilities vary across the country.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: 712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels.

The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent.

In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Effects of voluntary event cancellation and school closure as countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak in Japan\nBACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: An analysis of contact tracing protocol in an over-dispersed SEIQR Covid-like disease\nThe aim of this work is to study an over-dispersed SEIQR infectious disease and obtain optimal methods of contact tracing. A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Role of antibodies, inflammatory markers, and echocardiographic findings in post-acute cardiopulmonary symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nBACKGROUNDShortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations occur as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), but whether symptoms are associated with echocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers, or markers of systemic inflammation remains unknown. METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive.

This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: The effects of the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation strategy of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China\nMotivated by the quick control in Wuhan, China, and the rapid spread in other countries of COVID-19, we investigate the questions that what is the turning point in Wuhan by quantifying the variety of basic reproductive number after the lockdown city. The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population.

This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date.

The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou.

We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic. April 1, 2020 would be a reasonable date to lift quarantine in Hubei and Wuhan.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Factors Associated With Measles Transmission in the United States During the Postelimination Era\nIMPORTANCE: Measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States after the introduction of measles from endemic settings. OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths.

It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R(t) was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.51). INTERPRETATION: The first eight weeks following COVID-19 importation were characterised by early predominance of imported cases and relatively low mortality and transmission rates. Despite stringent lockdown measures, the second month following importation was characterised by community transmission and increasing disease burden in more populous provinces.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: A single holiday was the turning point of the COVID-19 policy of Israel\nOBJECTIVES: Despite an initial success, Israel's quarantine-isolation COVID-19 policy has abruptly collapsed. This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Early effects of ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective observational study\nBACKGROUND: In COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the effectiveness of ventilatory rescue strategies remains uncertain, with controversial efficacy on systemic oxygenation and no data available regarding cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available.

The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic.

Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Linking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: 685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\nNow answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this: Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission.

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

Within a compartmental realization of this model, we found the disease-free and the endemic stationary states. They exist in their respective restricted regions of the le via linear stability analysis. The expression for the basic reproductive number is obtained as well. The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm. These allowed to study the effect of the quarantine measures explicitly, via changing the neighbourhood size.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17).

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000).

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading.

Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States\nImportance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia.

Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West.

Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of the Distribution of the Individual Reproduction Number: The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe investigate the problem of estimating the distribution of the individual reproduction number governing the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of voluntary event cancellation and school closure as countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak in Japan\nBACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "An analysis of contact tracing protocol in an over-dispersed SEIQR Covid-like disease\nThe aim of this work is to study an over-dispersed SEIQR infectious disease and obtain optimal methods of contact tracing. A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Role of antibodies, inflammatory markers, and echocardiographic findings in post-acute cardiopulmonary symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nBACKGROUNDShortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations occur as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), but whether symptoms are associated with echocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers, or markers of systemic inflammation remains unknown. METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively.

The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The effects of the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation strategy of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China\nMotivated by the quick control in Wuhan, China, and the rapid spread in other countries of COVID-19, we investigate the questions that what is the turning point in Wuhan by quantifying the variety of basic reproductive number after the lockdown city. The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10.

Clinical diagnosis can quicken up NCP-confirmation such that the COVID-19 patients can be isolated without delay. So the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation is the turning point of the COVID-19 battle of Wuhan. The measure of clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation in Wuhan has delayed the growth and reduced size of the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased the peak number of the hospitalized cases by 96% in Wuhan.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days.

We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control.

The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mathematical Modeling of Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 Dynamics using CF and ABC Non-Singular Fractional Derivatives\nIn this article, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 transmission dynamics were studied to examine the utility of the SEIR compartmental model, using two non-singular kernel fractional derivative operators. This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, we examined the existence and uniqueness of the solution for both extensions of these models. Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer &#964; value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases. Concurrently, the CF approach demonstrated promise for use in mild cases.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic. April 1, 2020 would be a reasonable date to lift quarantine in Hubei and Wuhan.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Factors Associated With Measles Transmission in the United States During the Postelimination Era\nIMPORTANCE: Measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States after the introduction of measles from endemic settings. OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts.

We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data.

Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables.

It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

Method: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on all people with COVID-19 from the first date of admission of positive PCR patients with SARS-CoV-2 until September 21, 2020, in the area of Markazi Province in Khomein, Iran. Information on the records of definitively discharged and deceased patients due to COVID-19 (having positive PCR) was extracted from 20/2/2020 to 21/9/2020, and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19 were evaluated. The sample size was 691 people. Results: The CFR of the COVID-19 in the current study is 6.65%, and the rate of disease transmission among the sensitive population of Khomein city at the beginning of the study (March) averaged BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.75, and in the last month (September) of the study This value was reduced to BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.306. Conclusion: According to our study on Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19, showed that the prevalence of the disease was high in March, which due to lack of proper observance of health protocols, we saw this problem and in the months when people have more problems.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R(t) was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.51). INTERPRETATION: The first eight weeks following COVID-19 importation were characterised by early predominance of imported cases and relatively low mortality and transmission rates. Despite stringent lockdown measures, the second month following importation was characterised by community transmission and increasing disease burden in more populous provinces.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A single holiday was the turning point of the COVID-19 policy of Israel\nOBJECTIVES: Despite an initial success, Israel's quarantine-isolation COVID-19 policy has abruptly collapsed. This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Early effects of ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective observational study\nBACKGROUND: In COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the effectiveness of ventilatory rescue strategies remains uncertain, with controversial efficacy on systemic oxygenation and no data available regarding cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Linking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\nIs there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \"unanswerable\"): What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission.

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nComplex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy. The paper discusses further high-order interactions and other implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease transmission on a residential college campus.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nCompartmental and cellular automaton $SEIRS$ epidemiology models for the COVID-19 pandemic with the effects of temporal immunity and vaccination (preprint)/ en\nWe consider the $SEIRS$ epidemiology model with such features of the COVID-19 outbreak as: abundance of unidentified infected individuals, limited time of immunity and a possibility of vaccination. Within a compartmental realization of this model, we found the disease-free and the endemic stationary states. They exist in their respective restricted regions of the le via linear stability analysis. The expression for the basic reproductive number is obtained as well. The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm. These allowed to study the effect of the quarantine measures explicitly, via changing the neighbourhood size. The attempt is made to match both quarantine and vaccination measures aimed on balanced solution for effective suppression of the pandemic.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\n2019 Coronavirus pandemic in Turkey and across the world/ D\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcnyada ve T\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcrkiye'de 2019 Koronavir\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcs Pandemisi\nThe novel coronavirus, which was called 2019-nCoV at the beginning of the outbreak, was named SARS-CoV-2 later.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEpidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases and estimates of the reproductive numbers 1 month into the epidemic, Italy, 28 January to 31 March 2020\nBACKGROUND: On 20 February 2020, a locally acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case was detected in Lombardy, Italy. This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nQuantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17).

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEvaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nSurgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000).

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading.

A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nAssessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States\nImportance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nThe outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia. Little is known about its epidemiology. We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve. We estimate the basic reproduction number R(0) of SARS virus is 2.87 in mainland of China, very close to the estimations in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEstimation of the Outbreak Severity and Evaluation of Epidemic Prevention Ability of COVID-19 by Province in China.\nObjectives. To compare the epidemic prevention ability of COVID-19 of each province in China and to evaluate the existing prevention and control capacity of each province.Methods. We established a quasi-Poisson linear mixed-effects model using the case data in cities outside Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan was underestimated in the initial period of the outbreak. Provincial surveillance and emergency response capabilities vary across the country.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\n712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels.

Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nControlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nReport 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nA Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nOutbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nTransmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide.

The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEstimation of the Distribution of the Individual Reproduction Number: The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe investigate the problem of estimating the distribution of the individual reproduction number governing the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEffects of voluntary event cancellation and school closure as countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak in Japan\nBACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19. That policy has been designated as voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC). OBJECT: This study assesses VECSC effectiveness based on predicted outcomes.

The respective reproduction numbers for periods before VECSC (R(0)), during VECSC (R(e)), and after VECSC (R(a)) were estimated. RESULTS: Results suggest R(0) before VECSC as 2.534 [2.449, 2.598], R(e) during VECSC as 1.077 [0.948, 1.228], and R(a) after VECSC as 4.455 [3.615, 5.255].

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nAn analysis of contact tracing protocol in an over-dispersed SEIQR Covid-like disease\nThe aim of this work is to study an over-dispersed SEIQR infectious disease and obtain optimal methods of contact tracing. A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nRole of antibodies, inflammatory markers, and echocardiographic findings in post-acute cardiopulmonary symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nBACKGROUNDShortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations occur as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), but whether symptoms are associated with echocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers, or markers of systemic inflammation remains unknown. METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nHERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nImpact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nThe tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEffectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nSocial, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nA variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively.

Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1).

Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nMobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nThe effects of the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation strategy of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China\nMotivated by the quick control in Wuhan, China, and the rapid spread in other countries of COVID-19, we investigate the questions that what is the turning point in Wuhan by quantifying the variety of basic reproductive number after the lockdown city. The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10.

So the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation is the turning point of the COVID-19 battle of Wuhan. The measure of clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation in Wuhan has delayed the growth and reduced size of the COVID-19 epidemic, decreased the peak number of the hospitalized cases by 96% in Wuhan.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nImpact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nMATHEMATICAL PREDICTIONS FOR COVID-19 AS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC\nThis study shows that the disease free equilibrium (E_0 ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations.

This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control.

The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEstimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou.

This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic. April 1, 2020 would be a reasonable date to lift quarantine in Hubei and Wuhan.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nFactors Associated With Measles Transmission in the United States During the Postelimination Era\nIMPORTANCE: Measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States after the introduction of measles from endemic settings. OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEstimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nBidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nCOVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nClustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEffective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan\nDue to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nChallenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nPlasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R(t) was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.51). INTERPRETATION: The first eight weeks following COVID-19 importation were characterised by early predominance of imported cases and relatively low mortality and transmission rates. Despite stringent lockdown measures, the second month following importation was characterised by community transmission and increasing disease burden in more populous provinces.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nA single holiday was the turning point of the COVID-19 policy of Israel\nOBJECTIVES: Despite an initial success, Israel's quarantine-isolation COVID-19 policy has abruptly collapsed. This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEarly effects of ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective observational study\nBACKGROUND: In COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the effectiveness of ventilatory rescue strategies remains uncertain, with controversial efficacy on systemic oxygenation and no data available regarding cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nThe role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nSelf-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nPopulation Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nCharacterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nDynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nAligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic.

Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low.

Implications for evaluating potential control strategies from this uncontrolled R(o) are briefly discussed in the context of the maximum possible infected fraction of the population (needed to assess health care capacity) and mortality (especially in the USA given diverging projections). Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in R(o) > 2.7 within 44 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nAssessing the impact of COVID-19 border restrictions on dengue transmission in Yunnan Province, China: an observational epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis\nBackground: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, China implemented strict restrictions on cross-border travel to prevent disease importation. Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nLinking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nEffects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\n685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Answer based on context:\n\nTransmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

The clinical disease caused by the virus was also called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11.03.2020. As of 26.03.2020, there have been 462.684 confirmed cases and 20.834 deaths globally, and these numbers are expected to increase in the coming days. The dynamics of virus spread are investigated with various models and outbreak parameters such as incubation time and basic reproduction number (R0) is tried to be illuminated. According to official numbers, as of 03.26.2020, there have also been 3629 cases and 75 deaths in Turkey. COVID-19 Guideline prepared by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey is constantly updated with additional prevention and treatment strategies.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases and estimates of the reproductive numbers 1 month into the epidemic, Italy, 28 January to 31 March 2020\nBACKGROUND: On 20 February 2020, a locally acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case was detected in Lombardy, Italy. This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK. Our plots are available online and constantly updated with new data to closely monitor the changes in absolute numbers.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mathematical analysis of swine influenza epidemic model with optimal control\nA deterministic model is designed and used to analyze the transmission dynamics and the impact of antiviral drugs in controlling the spread of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic. In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is presented to identify and study the impact of critical model parameters on the reproduction number.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed. Both the SEIR-HL model and an R 0 calculator were computerized and made available to the community.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A simulation on potential secondary spread of novel coronavirus in an exported country using a stochastic epidemic seir model\nOngoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the number of new patients continues to increase. Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153478).

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors.

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy\nBACKGROUND: In the night of February 20, 2020, the first epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outside Asia was uncovered by the identification of its first patient in Lombardy region, Italy. In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces.

A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States\nImportance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data.

Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia. Little is known about its epidemiology. We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve. We estimate the basic reproduction number R(0) of SARS virus is 2.87 in mainland of China, very close to the estimations in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of the Outbreak Severity and Evaluation of Epidemic Prevention Ability of COVID-19 by Province in China.\nObjectives. To compare the epidemic prevention ability of COVID-19 of each province in China and to evaluate the existing prevention and control capacity of each province.Methods. We established a quasi-Poisson linear mixed-effects model using the case data in cities outside Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan was underestimated in the initial period of the outbreak. Provincial surveillance and emergency response capabilities vary across the country.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Simulating the progression of the COVID-19 disease in Cameroon using SIR models\nThis paper analyses the evolution of COVID 19 disease in Cameroon over the period March 6 April 2020 using SIR model. Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists.

Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25.

Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of voluntary event cancellation and school closure as countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak in Japan\nBACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19. That policy has been designated as voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC). OBJECT: This study assesses VECSC effectiveness based on predicted outcomes.

The respective reproduction numbers for periods before VECSC (R(0)), during VECSC (R(e)), and after VECSC (R(a)) were estimated. RESULTS: Results suggest R(0) before VECSC as 2.534 [2.449, 2.598], R(e) during VECSC as 1.077 [0.948, 1.228], and R(a) after VECSC as 4.455 [3.615, 5.255].

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "An analysis of contact tracing protocol in an over-dispersed SEIQR Covid-like disease\nThe aim of this work is to study an over-dispersed SEIQR infectious disease and obtain optimal methods of contact tracing. A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Role of antibodies, inflammatory markers, and echocardiographic findings in post-acute cardiopulmonary symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nBACKGROUNDShortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations occur as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), but whether symptoms are associated with echocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers, or markers of systemic inflammation remains unknown. METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques. An implementation of the model is available online at www.ipol.im/ern.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The impact of early social distancing at COVID-19 Outbreak in the largest Metropolitan Area of Brazil.\nWe evaluated the impact of early social distancing on the COVID-19 transmission in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Nursing Home Design and COVID-19: Implications for Guidelines and Regulation\nObjectives Nursing homes (NHs) are important health care and residential environments for the growing number of frail older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO.

The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "MATHEMATICAL PREDICTIONS FOR COVID-19 AS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC\nThis study shows that the disease free equilibrium (E_0 ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations.

This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mathematical Modeling of Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 Dynamics using CF and ABC Non-Singular Fractional Derivatives\nIn this article, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 transmission dynamics were studied to examine the utility of the SEIR compartmental model, using two non-singular kernel fractional derivative operators.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessing health burden risk and control effect on dengue fever infection in the southern region of Taiwan\nBACKGROUND: The high prevalence of dengue in Taiwan and the consecutive large dengue outbreaks in the period 2014\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 suggest that current control interventions are suboptimal. Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%. CONCLUSION: Our presented modeling framework provides a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and to quantify the effect of dengue control on dengue infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of basic reproduction number of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the outbreak in South Korea, 2015\nBACKGROUND: In South Korea, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in 2015. It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan\nDue to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui.

METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change.

According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases. CONCLUSIONS: A general lesson for health policymakers should be that even a short lapse in public responsiveness can lead to dire consequences.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Comparison of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision Codes With Electronic Medical Records Among Patients With Symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019\nImportance: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes are used to characterize coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related symptoms. Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Early effects of ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective observational study\nBACKGROUND: In COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the effectiveness of ventilatory rescue strategies remains uncertain, with controversial efficacy on systemic oxygenation and no data available regarding cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea\nSince the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Linking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.14 to \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nAnswer this question based on the article: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514]. Discussion and Concussion: One must be reminded that these results reflect only those at two weeks after the emergency declaration.

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK. Our plots are available online and constantly updated with new data to closely monitor the changes in absolute numbers.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mathematical analysis of swine influenza epidemic model with optimal control\nA deterministic model is designed and used to analyze the transmission dynamics and the impact of antiviral drugs in controlling the spread of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic. In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is presented to identify and study the impact of critical model parameters on the reproduction number. A time dependent optimal treatment strategy is designed using Pontryagin\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s maximum principle to minimize the treatment cost and the infected population.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled. Worldwide preparedness and vulnerability against COVID-19 should be regarded with more care.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Breaking the Waves: Modelling the Potential Impact of Public Health Measures to Defer the Epidemic Peak of Novel Influenza A/H1N1\nBACKGROUND: On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared phase 6 of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed. Both the SEIR-HL model and an R 0 calculator were computerized and made available to the community.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A simulation on potential secondary spread of novel coronavirus in an exported country using a stochastic epidemic seir model\nOngoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the number of new patients continues to increase. Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153478).

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors.

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing super-spreading events and age-specific infectivity of COVID-19 transmission in Georgia, USA\nAs the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact countries around the globe, refining our understanding of its transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions is imperative. In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading.

In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States\nImportance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia.

We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve.

We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Simulating the progression of the COVID-19 disease in Cameroon using SIR models\nThis paper analyses the evolution of COVID 19 disease in Cameroon over the period March 6 April 2020 using SIR model. Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected. Besides, implementation of efficient public health policies could help flattens the epidemic curve.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Quantifying pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of lateral flow testing in English secondary schools\nA range of measures have been implemented to control within-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission in England, including the self-isolation of close contacts and twice weekly mass testing of secondary school pupils using lateral flow device tests (LFTs). Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Improved inference of time-varying reproduction numbers during infectious disease outbreaks\nAccurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 data analysis and modeling in Palestine\nWe estimate an actual number of infected cases in Palestine based on the 18-day effect from infection to death. We find that the number of cases in April 22 varies between 506 and 2 026 infected cases. We also focus on the reproductive number in Palestine based on population dynamics with two SEIR models. Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Tracking the emergence of disparities in the subnational spread of COVID-19 in Brazil using an online application for real-time data visualisation: A longitudinal analysis\nBackground Brazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with over 20 million cases and 557,000 deaths reported by August 2021. Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates.

Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of voluntary event cancellation and school closure as countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak in Japan\nBACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity.

In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Role of antibodies, inflammatory markers, and echocardiographic findings in post-acute cardiopulmonary symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nBACKGROUNDShortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations occur as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), but whether symptoms are associated with echocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers, or markers of systemic inflammation remains unknown. METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dpopulation between 20\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015334 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009das having strong relationships with R(0), across countries. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques. An implementation of the model is available online at www.ipol.im/ern.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The impact of early social distancing at COVID-19 Outbreak in the largest Metropolitan Area of Brazil.\nWe evaluated the impact of early social distancing on the COVID-19 transmission in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area. Using an age-stratified SEIR model, we determined the time-dependent reproductive number, and forecasted the ICU beds necessary to tackle this epidemic.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Nursing Home Design and COVID-19: Implications for Guidelines and Regulation\nObjectives Nursing homes (NHs) are important health care and residential environments for the growing number of frail older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The effects of the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation strategy of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China\nMotivated by the quick control in Wuhan, China, and the rapid spread in other countries of COVID-19, we investigate the questions that what is the turning point in Wuhan by quantifying the variety of basic reproductive number after the lockdown city. The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "MATHEMATICAL PREDICTIONS FOR COVID-19 AS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC\nThis study shows that the disease free equilibrium (E_0 ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability. This implies that as a pandemic as declared by WHO (2020) the COVID-19 coronavirus does not have a curative vaccine yet and precautionary measures are advised through quarantine and observatory procedures. Also, the Basic Reproductive number (R_0<1) by Equation (33) shows that there is a chance of decline of secondary infections when the ratio between the incidence rate in the population and the total number of infected population quarantined with observatory procedure. The effort to evaluate the disease equilibrium shows that unless there is a dedicated effort from government, decision makers and stakeholders, the world would hardly be reed of the COVID-19 coronavirus and further spread is eminent and the rate of infection will continue to increase despite the increased rate of recovery because of the absence of vaccine at the moment.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The reproductive number of COVID-19 is higher compared to SARS coronavirus\nTeaser: Our review found the average R0 for 2019-nCoV to be 3.28, which exceeds WHO estimates of 1.4 to 2.5.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A social network analysis of the spread of COVID-19 in South Korea and policy implications\nThis study estimates the COVID-19 infection network from actual data and draws on implications for policy and research.

The main results are as follows: (i) out-degrees follow an extremely positively skewed distribution; (ii) removing the top nodes on the out-degree significantly decreases the size of the infection network, and (iii) the indicators that express the infectious power of the network change according to governmental measures.

Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created. Cumulation number of patients at the end of period 1 (day50) is 2868.7 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 1739.0.

Social distancing is a method to minimize crowd interactions and prevent the spread of disease within groups of people. This is a common practice which has been carried out over generations to minimize the spread of virus by limiting its reproduction rate (R0) among communities.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations. Finally, combining our results, we provided an effective lockdown policy to reduce future COVID-19 transmission in India.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The basic reproductive number and particle-to-plaque ratio: comparison of these two parameters of viral infectivity\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought more widespread attention to the basic reproductive number (R(o)), an epidemiologic measurement.

Information and awareness on preventative techniques can be spread through the use of social media, which has become an increasingly utilized tool in recent years. This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available. The findings indicate that social media is an integral part in the humanitarian logistics of pandemic and emergency preparedness, and contributes to the literature by informing best practices in the response to similar disasters.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Modeling transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo, Brazil\nINTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been transmitted to more than 200 countries, with 92.5 million cases and 1,981,678 deaths. METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic.

We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nosocomial outbreak in South Korea: insights from modeling\nBackground. Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission dynamics and successful control measures of SARS-CoV-2 in the mega-size city of Guangzhou, China.\nABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused a worldwide pandemic. Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mathematical Modeling of Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 Dynamics using CF and ABC Non-Singular Fractional Derivatives\nIn this article, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 transmission dynamics were studied to examine the utility of the SEIR compartmental model, using two non-singular kernel fractional derivative operators.

The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold. An earlier lockdown could have saved many lives.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessing health burden risk and control effect on dengue fever infection in the southern region of Taiwan\nBACKGROUND: The high prevalence of dengue in Taiwan and the consecutive large dengue outbreaks in the period 2014\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532015 suggest that current control interventions are suboptimal. Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%. CONCLUSION: Our presented modeling framework provides a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and to quantify the effect of dengue control on dengue infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of basic reproduction number of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the outbreak in South Korea, 2015\nBACKGROUND: In South Korea, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in 2015. It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan\nDue to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons).

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16).

After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea\nSince the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Linking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management. NIH TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: R01-194787\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Genomic epidemiology offers high resolution estimates of serial intervals for COVID-19\nEstimating key aspects of transmission is crucial in infectious disease control. Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.14 to \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 epidemic severity is associated with timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions\nBackground: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514]. Discussion and Concussion: One must be reminded that these results reflect only those at two weeks after the emergency declaration. The reproduction number probably changed thereafter continuously.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The Impact of Lockdown, Patient Classification, and the Large-Scale Case Screening on the Spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei\nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, is widely controlled now in China. However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January. From 28 January to 30 April, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 1.5014. Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

The numerical simulations are explored for various values of the fractional order. Finally, the effect of the ABC fractional-order derivative on suspected and infected individuals carefully is examined and compared with the real data.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Network assessment and modeling the management of an epidemic on a college campus with testing, contact tracing, and masking\nThere remains a great challenge to minimize the spread of epidemics. This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy. The paper discusses further high-order interactions and other implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease transmission on a residential college campus.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Compartmental and cellular automaton $SEIRS$ epidemiology models for the COVID-19 pandemic with the effects of temporal immunity and vaccination (preprint)/ en\nWe consider the $SEIRS$ epidemiology model with such features of the COVID-19 outbreak as: abundance of unidentified infected individuals, limited time of immunity and a possibility of vaccination. Within a compartmental realization of this model, we found the disease-free and the endemic stationary states. They exist in their respective restricted regions of the le via linear stability analysis. The expression for the basic reproductive number is obtained as well. The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm. These allowed to study the effect of the quarantine measures explicitly, via changing the neighbourhood size. The attempt is made to match both quarantine and vaccination measures aimed on balanced solution for effective suppression of the pandemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "2019 Coronavirus pandemic in Turkey and across the world/ D\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcnyada ve T\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcrkiye'de 2019 Koronavir\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcs Pandemisi\nThe novel coronavirus, which was called 2019-nCoV at the beginning of the outbreak, was named SARS-CoV-2 later.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases and estimates of the reproductive numbers 1 month into the epidemic, Italy, 28 January to 31 March 2020\nBACKGROUND: On 20 February 2020, a locally acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case was detected in Lombardy, Italy. This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient.

A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled. Worldwide preparedness and vulnerability against COVID-19 should be regarded with more care.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Breaking the Waves: Modelling the Potential Impact of Public Health Measures to Defer the Epidemic Peak of Novel Influenza A/H1N1\nBACKGROUND: On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared phase 6 of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed. Both the SEIR-HL model and an R 0 calculator were computerized and made available to the community.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A simulation on potential secondary spread of novel coronavirus in an exported country using a stochastic epidemic seir model\nOngoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the number of new patients continues to increase. Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153478).

However, better case scenarios with different parameters led to no secondary cases. Altering parameters, especially time to hospital visit. could change the impact of a secondary outbreak.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors. Aggressive curative resection remains to be the optimal option for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Non-curative resection, pathological differentiation, and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/ dL were associated with dismal prognosis.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimating epidemiological quantities from repeated cross-sectional prevalence measurements\nBackgroundRepeated measurements of cross-sectional prevalence of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) positivity or seropositivity provide rich insight into the dynamics of an infection. The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models. Studies or public health surveillance methods based on similar designs offer opportunities for further improving our understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens and their interaction with population-level immunity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessing the Transmissibility of the New SARS-CoV-2 Variants: From Delta to Omicron\nOmicron, the latest SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC), first appeared in Africa in November 2021. At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing super-spreading events and age-specific infectivity of COVID-19 transmission in Georgia, USA\nAs the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact countries around the globe, refining our understanding of its transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions is imperative. In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy\nBACKGROUND: In the night of February 20, 2020, the first epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outside Asia was uncovered by the identification of its first patient in Lombardy region, Italy. In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States\nImportance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia.

We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve.

We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Simulating the progression of the COVID-19 disease in Cameroon using SIR models\nThis paper analyses the evolution of COVID 19 disease in Cameroon over the period March 6 April 2020 using SIR model. Specifically, 1) we evaluate the basic reproduction number of the virus. 2) Determine the peak of the infection and the spread-out period of the disease. 3) Simulate the interventions of public health authorities. Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected. Besides, implementation of efficient public health policies could help flattens the epidemic curve.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Quantifying pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of lateral flow testing in English secondary schools\nA range of measures have been implemented to control within-school SARS-CoV-2 transmission in England, including the self-isolation of close contacts and twice weekly mass testing of secondary school pupils using lateral flow device tests (LFTs). Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Improved inference of time-varying reproduction numbers during infectious disease outbreaks\nAccurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 data analysis and modeling in Palestine\nWe estimate an actual number of infected cases in Palestine based on the 18-day effect from infection to death. We find that the number of cases in April 22 varies between 506 and 2 026 infected cases. We also focus on the reproductive number in Palestine based on population dynamics with two SEIR models. Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1. Changes to the transmission rate (over time) would be advisable, to fall R0 below the critical threshold.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Time from symptom onset to hospitalisation of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases: Implications for the proportion of transmissions from infectors with few symptoms\nInterventions targeting symptomatic hosts and their contacts were successful in bringing the 2003 SARS pandemic under control. In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Tracking the emergence of disparities in the subnational spread of COVID-19 in Brazil using an online application for real-time data visualisation: A longitudinal analysis\nBackground Brazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with over 20 million cases and 557,000 deaths reported by August 2021. Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of the Distribution of the Individual Reproduction Number: The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe investigate the problem of estimating the distribution of the individual reproduction number governing the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of voluntary event cancellation and school closure as countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak in Japan\nBACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "An analysis of contact tracing protocol in an over-dispersed SEIQR Covid-like disease\nThe aim of this work is to study an over-dispersed SEIQR infectious disease and obtain optimal methods of contact tracing. A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society.

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study.

In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques. An implementation of the model is available online at www.ipol.im/ern.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The impact of early social distancing at COVID-19 Outbreak in the largest Metropolitan Area of Brazil.\nWe evaluated the impact of early social distancing on the COVID-19 transmission in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Nursing Home Design and COVID-19: Implications for Guidelines and Regulation\nObjectives Nursing homes (NHs) are important health care and residential environments for the growing number of frail older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The effects of the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation strategy of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China\nMotivated by the quick control in Wuhan, China, and the rapid spread in other countries of COVID-19, we investigate the questions that what is the turning point in Wuhan by quantifying the variety of basic reproductive number after the lockdown city.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

Social distancing is a method to minimize crowd interactions and prevent the spread of disease within groups of people. This is a common practice which has been carried out over generations to minimize the spread of virus by limiting its reproduction rate (R0) among communities. The article focuses on how social distancing has been used to deal previous pandemics globally and the issues that needs to be addressed to tackle the COVID-19 threat.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Assessment of Lockdown Effect in Some States and Overall India: A Predictive Mathematical Study on COVID-19 Outbreak\nIn the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, Govt. has implemented a nationwide lockdown to reduce COVID-19 transmission in India. To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations. Finally, combining our results, we provided an effective lockdown policy to reduce future COVID-19 transmission in India.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The basic reproductive number and particle-to-plaque ratio: comparison of these two parameters of viral infectivity\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought more widespread attention to the basic reproductive number (R(o)), an epidemiologic measurement.

Information and awareness on preventative techniques can be spread through the use of social media, which has become an increasingly utilized tool in recent years. This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available. The findings indicate that social media is an integral part in the humanitarian logistics of pandemic and emergency preparedness, and contributes to the literature by informing best practices in the response to similar disasters.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Modeling transmission dynamics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo, Brazil\nINTRODUCTION: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has been transmitted to more than 200 countries, with 92.5 million cases and 1,981,678 deaths. METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6-7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2-2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nosocomial outbreak in South Korea: insights from modeling\nBackground. Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission dynamics and successful control measures of SARS-CoV-2 in the mega-size city of Guangzhou, China.\nABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused a worldwide pandemic. Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Mathematical Modeling of Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 Dynamics using CF and ABC Non-Singular Fractional Derivatives\nIn this article, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 transmission dynamics were studied to examine the utility of the SEIR compartmental model, using two non-singular kernel fractional derivative operators. This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, we examined the existence and uniqueness of the solution for both extensions of these models. Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer &#964; value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases. Concurrently, the CF approach demonstrated promise for use in mild cases.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic. April 1, 2020 would be a reasonable date to lift quarantine in Hubei and Wuhan.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Factors Associated With Measles Transmission in the United States During the Postelimination Era\nIMPORTANCE: Measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States after the introduction of measles from endemic settings. OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A dengue\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153mosquito\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153human transmission dynamic was used to quantify the vector\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153host interactions and to estimate the disease epidemics. We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%. CONCLUSION: Our presented modeling framework provides a useful tool to measure dengue health burden risk and to quantify the effect of dengue control on dengue infection prevalence and disease incidence in the southern region of Taiwan.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Estimation of basic reproduction number of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) during the outbreak in South Korea, 2015\nBACKGROUND: In South Korea, an outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) occurred in 2015. It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan\nDue to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

Our findings provide a timeline of the effectiveness of the implemented lockdown, which is relevant for a large number of countries that followed Italy in enforcing similar measures.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Evaluate the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19\nIntroduction: SARS-CoV-2 primarily affects a person's respiratory system and leads to the spread of pathogenicity in the person and therefore this study evaluated the Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19. Method: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on all people with COVID-19 from the first date of admission of positive PCR patients with SARS-CoV-2 until September 21, 2020, in the area of Markazi Province in Khomein, Iran. Information on the records of definitively discharged and deceased patients due to COVID-19 (having positive PCR) was extracted from 20/2/2020 to 21/9/2020, and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19 were evaluated. The sample size was 691 people. Results: The CFR of the COVID-19 in the current study is 6.65%, and the rate of disease transmission among the sensitive population of Khomein city at the beginning of the study (March) averaged BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.75, and in the last month (September) of the study This value was reduced to BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.306. Conclusion: According to our study on Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19, showed that the prevalence of the disease was high in March, which due to lack of proper observance of health protocols, we saw this problem and in the months when people have more problems.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%).

Despite stringent lockdown measures, the second month following importation was characterised by community transmission and increasing disease burden in more populous provinces.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "A single holiday was the turning point of the COVID-19 policy of Israel\nOBJECTIVES: Despite an initial success, Israel's quarantine-isolation COVID-19 policy has abruptly collapsed. This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases. CONCLUSIONS: A general lesson for health policymakers should be that even a short lapse in public responsiveness can lead to dire consequences.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Comparison of International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision Codes With Electronic Medical Records Among Patients With Symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019\nImportance: International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes are used to characterize coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)-related symptoms. Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Early effects of ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective observational study\nBACKGROUND: In COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the effectiveness of ventilatory rescue strategies remains uncertain, with controversial efficacy on systemic oxygenation and no data available regarding cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive.

Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission potential of COVID-19 in South Korea\nSince the first identified individual of 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection on Jan 20, 2020 in South Korea, the number of confirmed cases rapidly increased. As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned. Summarizing the lessons learned could help in designing effective public responses for constraining future waves of COVID-19 worldwide.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The introduction of population migration to SEIAR for COVID-19 epidemic modelling with an efficient intervention strategy\nIn this paper, we present a mathematical model of an infectious disease according to the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Linking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management. NIH TRIAL REGISTRY NUMBER: R01-194787\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Genomic epidemiology offers high resolution estimates of serial intervals for COVID-19\nEstimating key aspects of transmission is crucial in infectious disease control. Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.14 to \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant. Overall, HFMD transmission was moderate in Hong Kong and was mainly associated with depletion of susceptibles. Limited impact was suggested from meteorological factors and school holidays.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "COVID-19 epidemic severity is associated with timing of non-pharmaceutical interventions\nBackground: Unprecedented public health interventions including travel restrictions and national lockdowns have been implemented to stem the COVID-19 epidemic, but the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions is still debated. International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\nAnswer this question: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514]. Discussion and Concussion: One must be reminded that these results reflect only those at two weeks after the emergency declaration. The reproduction number probably changed thereafter continuously.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question The Impact of Lockdown, Patient Classification, and the Large-Scale Case Screening on the Spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei\nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, is widely controlled now in China. However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January.

Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC).

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy.

Within a compartmental realization of this model, we found the disease-free and the endemic stationary states. They exist in their respective restricted regions of the le via linear stability analysis. The expression for the basic reproductive number is obtained as well. The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm. These allowed to study the effect of the quarantine measures explicitly, via changing the neighbourhood size.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17).

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China. Simulations using stochastic SEIR model were conducted, assuming one patient was imported to a community. Among 45 possible scenarios we prepared, the worst scenario resulted in the total number of persons recovered or removed to be 997 (95% CrI 990\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531000) at day 100 and a maximum number of symptomatic infectious patients per day of 335 (95% CrI 232\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153478).

However, better case scenarios with different parameters led to no secondary cases. Altering parameters, especially time to hospital visit. could change the impact of a secondary outbreak. With these multiple scenarios with different parameters, healthcare professionals might be able to better prepare for this viral infection.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Enhancing genetic disease control by selecting for lower host infectivity and susceptibility\nInfectious diseases have a huge impact on animal health, production and welfare, and human health. Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000). Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors. Aggressive curative resection remains to be the optimal option for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Non-curative resection, pathological differentiation, and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/ dL were associated with dismal prognosis.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Estimating epidemiological quantities from repeated cross-sectional prevalence measurements\nBackgroundRepeated measurements of cross-sectional prevalence of Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) positivity or seropositivity provide rich insight into the dynamics of an infection. The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models. Studies or public health surveillance methods based on similar designs offer opportunities for further improving our understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens and their interaction with population-level immunity.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Assessing the Transmissibility of the New SARS-CoV-2 Variants: From Delta to Omicron\nOmicron, the latest SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC), first appeared in Africa in November 2021. At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Characterizing super-spreading events and age-specific infectivity of COVID-19 transmission in Georgia, USA\nAs the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact countries around the globe, refining our understanding of its transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions is imperative. In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy\nBACKGROUND: In the night of February 20, 2020, the first epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outside Asia was uncovered by the identification of its first patient in Lombardy region, Italy. In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States\nImportance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia.

We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve.

We established a quasi-Poisson linear mixed-effects model using the case data in cities outside Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question 712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores.

By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America.

The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Improved inference of time-varying reproduction numbers during infectious disease outbreaks\nAccurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question COVID-19 data analysis and modeling in Palestine\nWe estimate an actual number of infected cases in Palestine based on the 18-day effect from infection to death. We find that the number of cases in April 22 varies between 506 and 2 026 infected cases. We also focus on the reproductive number in Palestine based on population dynamics with two SEIR models. Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1. Changes to the transmission rate (over time) would be advisable, to fall R0 below the critical threshold.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Time from symptom onset to hospitalisation of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases: Implications for the proportion of transmissions from infectors with few symptoms\nInterventions targeting symptomatic hosts and their contacts were successful in bringing the 2003 SARS pandemic under control. In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Tracking the emergence of disparities in the subnational spread of COVID-19 in Brazil using an online application for real-time data visualisation: A longitudinal analysis\nBackground Brazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with over 20 million cases and 557,000 deaths reported by August 2021. Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Estimation of the Distribution of the Individual Reproduction Number: The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe investigate the problem of estimating the distribution of the individual reproduction number governing the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Effects of voluntary event cancellation and school closure as countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak in Japan\nBACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity.

In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points.

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study.

Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results.

In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]).

In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]).

We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Nursing Home Design and COVID-19: Implications for Guidelines and Regulation\nObjectives Nursing homes (NHs) are important health care and residential environments for the growing number of frail older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question The effects of the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation strategy of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China\nMotivated by the quick control in Wuhan, China, and the rapid spread in other countries of COVID-19, we investigate the questions that what is the turning point in Wuhan by quantifying the variety of basic reproductive number after the lockdown city.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations.

We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6-7 days and a basic reproductive number (R0) of 2.2-2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) nosocomial outbreak in South Korea: insights from modeling\nBackground. Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. R(0) is estimated to range between 7.0 and 19.3. Discussion and Conclusion. The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Transmission dynamics and successful control measures of SARS-CoV-2 in the mega-size city of Guangzhou, China.\nABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused a worldwide pandemic. Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Mathematical Modeling of Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 Dynamics using CF and ABC Non-Singular Fractional Derivatives\nIn this article, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 transmission dynamics were studied to examine the utility of the SEIR compartmental model, using two non-singular kernel fractional derivative operators. This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points.

Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer &#964; value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic.

OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die.

We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data.

Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Effective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan\nDue to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Plasma 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan levels predict adverse clinical outcomes in critical illness\nBACKGROUND: The fungal cell wall constituent 1,3-\u00c3\u017d\u00c2\u00b2-d-glucan (BDG) is a pathogen-associated molecular pattern that can stimulate innate immunity. We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

Method: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on all people with COVID-19 from the first date of admission of positive PCR patients with SARS-CoV-2 until September 21, 2020, in the area of Markazi Province in Khomein, Iran. Information on the records of definitively discharged and deceased patients due to COVID-19 (having positive PCR) was extracted from 20/2/2020 to 21/9/2020, and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19 were evaluated. The sample size was 691 people. Results: The CFR of the COVID-19 in the current study is 6.65%, and the rate of disease transmission among the sensitive population of Khomein city at the beginning of the study (March) averaged BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.75, and in the last month (September) of the study This value was reduced to BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.306. Conclusion: According to our study on Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19, showed that the prevalence of the disease was high in March, which due to lack of proper observance of health protocols, we saw this problem and in the months when people have more problems.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R(t) was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.51).

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Linking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario.

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question 685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Read this article and answer this question Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia.

Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\nWhat are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020.

We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514]. Discussion and Concussion: One must be reminded that these results reflect only those at two weeks after the emergency declaration. The reproduction number probably changed thereafter continuously.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January. From 28 January to 30 April, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 1.5014. Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy. The paper discusses further high-order interactions and other implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease transmission on a residential college campus.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Within a compartmental realization of this model, we found the disease-free and the endemic stationary states. They exist in their respective restricted regions of the le via linear stability analysis. The expression for the basic reproductive number is obtained as well. The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK.

Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17).

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Multivariate analysis revealed that non-curative resection (RR: 2.414, 95% CI 1.586\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.676, P = 0.000), pathological differentiation (P = 0.015) and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/dL (RR: 1.844, 95% CI 1.235\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.752, P = 0.003) were independent prognostic factors. Aggressive curative resection remains to be the optimal option for hilar cholangiocarcinoma. Non-curative resection, pathological differentiation, and preoperative serum total bilirubin above 10 mg/ dL were associated with dismal prognosis.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) Community Infection Survey publishes such measurements for SARS-CoV-2 on a weekly basis based on testing enrolled households, contributing to situational awareness in the country. Here we present estimates of time-varying and static epidemiological quantities that were derived from the estimates published by ONS. MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models. Studies or public health surveillance methods based on similar designs offer opportunities for further improving our understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens and their interaction with population-level immunity.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question. What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy\nBACKGROUND: In the night of February 20, 2020, the first epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outside Asia was uncovered by the identification of its first patient in Lombardy region, Italy. In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Little is known about its epidemiology. We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve. We estimate the basic reproduction number R(0) of SARS virus is 2.87 in mainland of China, very close to the estimations in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

To compare the epidemic prevention ability of COVID-19 of each province in China and to evaluate the existing prevention and control capacity of each province.Methods. We established a quasi-Poisson linear mixed-effects model using the case data in cities outside Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan was underestimated in the initial period of the outbreak. Provincial surveillance and emergency response capabilities vary across the country.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS. CONCLUSIONS: China has taken more prompt and effective responses to combat COVID-19 by learning lessons from SARS, providing us with some epidemiological clues to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic worldwide.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question. What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Improved inference of time-varying reproduction numbers during infectious disease outbreaks\nAccurate estimation of the parameters characterising infectious disease transmission is vital for optimising control interventions during epidemics. A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

We find that the number of cases in April 22 varies between 506 and 2 026 infected cases. We also focus on the reproductive number in Palestine based on population dynamics with two SEIR models. Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1. Changes to the transmission rate (over time) would be advisable, to fall R0 below the critical threshold.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]).

In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0).

Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020.

We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days.

The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, we examined the existence and uniqueness of the solution for both extensions of these models. Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer &#964; value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases. Concurrently, the CF approach demonstrated promise for use in mild cases. Furthermore, the integer &#964; value results of both approaches were identical.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic. April 1, 2020 would be a reasonable date to lift quarantine in Hubei and Wuhan.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts.

We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Modelling COVID-19 transmission in the United States through interstate and foreign travels and evaluating impact of governmental public health interventions\nBackground: The first case of COVID-19 was reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel. The government can further strengthen restrictions and reduce spread within the nation more effectively by implementing restrictions on interstate travel.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

We hypothesized that BDG from colonizing fungi in critically ill patients may translocate into the systemic circulation and be associated with host inflammation and outcomes. METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

Method: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on all people with COVID-19 from the first date of admission of positive PCR patients with SARS-CoV-2 until September 21, 2020, in the area of Markazi Province in Khomein, Iran. Information on the records of definitively discharged and deceased patients due to COVID-19 (having positive PCR) was extracted from 20/2/2020 to 21/9/2020, and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19 were evaluated. The sample size was 691 people. Results: The CFR of the COVID-19 in the current study is 6.65%, and the rate of disease transmission among the sensitive population of Khomein city at the beginning of the study (March) averaged BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.75, and in the last month (September) of the study This value was reduced to BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.306. Conclusion: According to our study on Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19, showed that the prevalence of the disease was high in March, which due to lack of proper observance of health protocols, we saw this problem and in the months when people have more problems.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R(t) was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.51). INTERPRETATION: The first eight weeks following COVID-19 importation were characterised by early predominance of imported cases and relatively low mortality and transmission rates. Despite stringent lockdown measures, the second month following importation was characterised by community transmission and increasing disease burden in more populous provinces.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method.

Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model. The results demonstrate that both data series plausibly follow from the transmission model specified and provide a 95% confidence interval estimate of the reproductive number R(0) \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00cb\u2020 2.4 \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b1 0.2. Sensitivity analysis accounting for alternative lag distributions from infection until hospitalization and sludge RNA concentration respectively suggests that the detection of viral RNA in sewage sludge leads hospital admissions by 3 to 5 days on average. The analysis suggests that stay-at-home restrictions plausibly removed 89% of the population from the risk of infection with the remaining 11% exposed to an unmitigated outbreak that infected 9.3% of the total population.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

As of Feb 26, 2020, 1,261 cases of COVID-19 including 12 deaths were confirmed in South Korea. Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned. Summarizing the lessons learned could help in designing effective public responses for constraining future waves of COVID-19 worldwide.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The proposed enhanced model, which will be referred to as the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model with population migration, is inspired by the role that asymptomatic infected individuals, as well as population movements can play a crucial role in spreading the virus. In the model, the infected and the basic reproduction numbers are compared under the influence of intervention policies.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0.

During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question.

Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nBased on the above article, answer a question. What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?", "Context: Effect of emergency declaration for the COVID \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak in Tokyo, Japan in the first two weeks\nBackground: Prime Minister of Japan Abe declared an emergency to control the COVID\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212219 outbreak on April 7, 2020. He asked almost half of the population of Japan to reduce their personal contacts by 70\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u212280%. Object: This study estimates the effectiveness of that emergency declaration. Method: We applied a simple susceptible\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122infected\u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122recovery model to data of patients with symptoms in Tokyo, Japan for January 14 \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 April 21 as of April 22. We estimate the reproduction number in four periods: R0 before voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC) which was introduced since February 27 to March 19, Rv during the VECSC, Ra after VECSC, and Re after the emergency declaration. Results: Results suggest that the value of R0 was estimated as 1.267; its range was [1.214, 1.341]. However, Rv was estimated as 2.360 [1.844, 2.623]. Ra was estimated as 2.307 [2.035, 2.794] and Re was 0.462 [0.347, 0.514]. Discussion and Concussion: One must be reminded that these results reflect only those at two weeks after the emergency declaration. The reproduction number probably changed thereafter continuously.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: The Impact of Lockdown, Patient Classification, and the Large-Scale Case Screening on the Spread of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Hubei\nThe coronavirus disease (COVID-19) which emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, is widely controlled now in China. However, the global epidemic is still severe. To study and comment on Hubei's approaches for responding to the disease, the paper considered some factors such as suspected cases (part of them are influenza patients or common pneumonia patients, etc.), quarantine, patient classification (three types), clinically diagnosed cases, and lockdown of Wuhan and Hubei. After that, the paper established an SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei published by the Hubei Health Commission from 10 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 and used the fminsearch optimization method to estimate the optimal parameters of the model. We obtained the basic reproduction number \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 3.1571 from 10 to 22 January. \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) was calculated as 2.0471 from 23 to 27 January. From 28 January to 30 April, \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u017e\u00e2\u20ac\u00ba(0) = 1.5014. Through analysis, it is not hard to find that the patients without classification during the period of confirmed cases will result in the cumulative number of cases in Hubei to increase. In addition, regarding the lockdown measures implemented by Hubei during the epidemic, our simulations also show that if the lockdown time of either Hubei or Wuhan is advanced, it will effectively curb the spread of the epidemic. If the lockdown measures are not taken, the total cumulative number of cases will increase substantially. From the results of the study, it can be concluded that the lockdown, patient classification, and the large-scale case screening are essential to slow the spread of COVID-19, which can provide references for other countries or regions.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Complex mathematical SIR model for spreading of COVID-19 virus with Mittag-Leffler kernel\nThis paper investigates a new model on coronavirus-19 disease (COVID-19), that is complex fractional SIR epidemic model with a nonstandard nonlinear incidence rate and a recovery, where derivative operator with Mittag-Leffler kernel in the Caputo sense (ABC). The model has two equilibrium points when the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] ; a disease-free equilibrium [Formula: see text] and a disease endemic equilibrium [Formula: see text] . The disease-free equilibrium stage is locally and globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number [Formula: see text] , we show that the endemic equilibrium state is locally asymptotically stable if [Formula: see text] .

The numerical simulations are explored for various values of the fractional order. Finally, the effect of the ABC fractional-order derivative on suspected and infected individuals carefully is examined and compared with the real data.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Network assessment and modeling the management of an epidemic on a college campus with testing, contact tracing, and masking\nThere remains a great challenge to minimize the spread of epidemics. This may be particularly true on densely populated, residential college campuses. To construct class and residential networks I used data from a four-year, residential liberal arts college with 5539 students. Equal-sized random networks also were created for each day. Different levels of compliance with mask use (none to 100%), mask efficacy (50% to 100%), and testing frequency (daily, or every 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, or 105 days) were assessed. Tests were assumed to be only 90% accurate and positive results were used to isolate individuals. I also tested the effectiveness of contact tracing and subsequent quarantining of neighbors of infectious individuals. I used class enrollment and residence data from a college with 5539 students to analyze network structure and test the epidemic potential of the infectious disease agent SARS-CoV-2. Average path lengths were longer in the college networks compared to random networks. Students in larger majors generally had shorter average path lengths. Average transitivity (clustering) was lower on days when students most frequently were in class (MWF). Degree distributions were generally large and right skewed, ranging from 0 to 719. Simulations began by inoculating twenty students (10 exposed and 10 infectious) with SARS-CoV-2 on the first day of the fall semester and ended once the disease was cleared. Transmission probability was calculated based on an R0 = 2:4. Without interventions epidemics resulted in most students becoming infected and lasted into the second semester. On average students in the college networks experienced fewer infections, shorter duration, and lower epidemic peaks that occurred compared to dynamics on equal-sized random networks. The most important factors in reducing case numbers were the proportion masking and the frequency of testing, followed by contact tracing and mask efficacy. The paper discusses further high-order interactions and other implications of non-pharmaceutical interventions for disease transmission on a residential college campus.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Compartmental and cellular automaton $SEIRS$ epidemiology models for the COVID-19 pandemic with the effects of temporal immunity and vaccination (preprint)/ en\nWe consider the $SEIRS$ epidemiology model with such features of the COVID-19 outbreak as: abundance of unidentified infected individuals, limited time of immunity and a possibility of vaccination. Within a compartmental realization of this model, we found the disease-free and the endemic stationary states. They exist in their respective restricted regions of the le via linear stability analysis. The expression for the basic reproductive number is obtained as well. The positions and heights of a first peak for the fractions of infected individuals are obtained numerically and are fitted to simple algebraic forms, that depend on model rates. Computer simulations of a lattice-based realization for this model was performed by means of the cellular automaton algorithm. These allowed to study the effect of the quarantine measures explicitly, via changing the neighbourhood size. The attempt is made to match both quarantine and vaccination measures aimed on balanced solution for effective suppression of the pandemic.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: 2019 Coronavirus pandemic in Turkey and across the world/ D\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcnyada ve T\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcrkiye'de 2019 Koronavir\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00bcs Pandemisi\nThe novel coronavirus, which was called 2019-nCoV at the beginning of the outbreak, was named SARS-CoV-2 later. The clinical disease caused by the virus was also called Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11.03.2020. As of 26.03.2020, there have been 462.684 confirmed cases and 20.834 deaths globally, and these numbers are expected to increase in the coming days. The dynamics of virus spread are investigated with various models and outbreak parameters such as incubation time and basic reproduction number (R0) is tried to be illuminated. According to official numbers, as of 03.26.2020, there have also been 3629 cases and 75 deaths in Turkey. COVID-19 Guideline prepared by the Ministry of Health of the Republic of Turkey is constantly updated with additional prevention and treatment strategies.

In this study we used daily infections situation report of COVID - 19 published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to estimate Nigeria's TD - R0 and then repeated the same for the six geo - political zones in the country. Estimates of TD - R0 values for the country from the 23&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; of March - 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May 2020 fluctuated with a maximum of 2.3 (95% CrI) on the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of April and a minimum of 0.83 (95% CrI) on the 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; May 2020. Despite the decline in TD - R0 since the early stages of the outbreak of COVID - 19 in Nigeria suggesting a fall in the expected rate of secondary infection apart from the northwest and the northeast geo - political zones values remain above 1.0 for other zones and the country, generally. The Kolmogorov - Smirnov (KS) test was used to test the null hypothesis stating that the means of TD - R0 across the geo-political zones does not follow the same distribution pattern. After making adjustments for Type 1 - error we accepted the null hypothesis (p &lt; 0.05) for six pairs of geo-political zones. We conclude that our findings are significant in studying the COVID - 19 epidemic in Nigeria and important in evaluating the strategies deployed by governments at the national and regional levels, thus, the same method can be replicated across Africa.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 cases and estimates of the reproductive numbers 1 month into the epidemic, Italy, 28 January to 31 March 2020\nBACKGROUND: On 20 February 2020, a locally acquired coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case was detected in Lombardy, Italy. This was the first signal of ongoing transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in the country. The number of cases in Italy increased rapidly and the country became the first in Europe to experience a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. AIM: Our aim was to describe the epidemiology and transmission dynamics of the first COVID-19 cases in Italy amid ongoing control measures. METHODS: We analysed all RT-PCR-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported to the national integrated surveillance system until 31 March 2020. We provide a descriptive epidemiological summary and estimate the basic and net reproductive numbers by region. RESULTS: Of the 98,716 cases of COVID-19 analysed, 9,512 were healthcare workers. Of the 10,943 reported COVID-19-associated deaths (crude case fatality ratio: 11.1%) 49.5% occurred in cases older than 80 years. Male sex and age were independent risk factors for COVID-19 death. Estimates of R(0) varied between 2.50 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.83) in Tuscany and 3.00 (95% CI: 2.68\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.33) in Lazio. The net reproduction number R(t) in northern regions started decreasing immediately after the first detection. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak in Italy showed a clustering onset similar to the one in Wuhan, China. R(0) at 2.96 in Lombardy combined with delayed detection explains the high case load and rapid geographical spread. Overall, R(t) in Italian regions showed early signs of decrease, with large diversity in incidence, supporting the importance of combined non-pharmacological control measures.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Quantification of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7 in Switzerland\nIn December 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) reported a SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VoC) which is now coined B.1.1.7. Based on the UK data and later additional data from other countries, a transmission advantage of around 40-80% was estimated for this variant. In Switzerland, since spring 2020, we perform whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 samples obtained from a large diagnostic lab (Viollier AG) on a weekly basis for genomic surveillance. The lab processes SARS-CoV-2 samples from across Switzerland. Based on a total of 7631 sequences obtained from samples collected between 14.12.2020 and 11.02.2021 at Viollier AG, we determine the relative proportion of the B.1.1.7 variant on a daily basis. In addition, we use data from a second lab (Dr Risch) screening all their samples for the B.1.1.7 variant. These two datasets represent 11.5 % of all SARS-CoV-2 confirmed cases across Switzerland during the considered time period. They allow us to quantify the transmission advantage of the B.1.1.7 variant on a national and a regional scale. Taking all our data and estimates together, we propose a transmission advantage of 49-65% of B.1.1.7 compared to the other circulating variants. Further, we estimate the effective reproductive number through time for B.1.1.7 and the other variants, again pointing to a higher transmission rate of B.1.1.7. In particular, for the time period 01.01.2021-17.01.2021, we estimate an average reproductive number for B.1.1.7 of 1.28 [1.07-1.49] while the estimate for the other variants is 0.83 [0.63-1.03], based on the total number of confirmed cases and our Viollier sequencing data. Switzerland tightened measures on 18.01.2021. A comparison of the empirically confirmed case numbers up to 20.02.2021 to a very simple model using the estimates of the reproductive number from the first half of January provides indication that the rate of spread of all variants slowed down recently. In summary, the dynamics of increase in frequency of B.1.1.7 is as expected based on the observations in the UK. Our plots are available online and constantly updated with new data to closely monitor the changes in absolute numbers.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Mathematical analysis of swine influenza epidemic model with optimal control\nA deterministic model is designed and used to analyze the transmission dynamics and the impact of antiviral drugs in controlling the spread of the 2009 swine influenza pandemic. In particular, the model considers the administration of the antiviral both as a preventive as well as a therapeutic agent. Rigorous analysis of the model reveals that its disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under a condition involving the threshold quantity-reproduction number [Formula: see text] . The disease persists uniformly if [Formula: see text] and the model has a unique endemic equilibrium under certain condition. The model undergoes backward bifurcation if the antiviral drugs are completely efficient. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis is presented to identify and study the impact of critical model parameters on the reproduction number. A time dependent optimal treatment strategy is designed using Pontryagin\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2s maximum principle to minimize the treatment cost and the infected population.

Objective: In this study, we use the time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) to comprise the COVID transmissibility across different countries. Methods: We used data from Jan 20, 2019, to Feb 29, 2020, on the number of newly confirmed cases, obtained from the reports published by the CDC, to infer the incidence of infectious over time. A two-step procedure was used to estimate the Rt. The first step used data on known index-secondary cases pairs, from publicly available case reports, to estimate the serial interval distribution. The second step estimated the Rt jointly from the incidence data and the information data in the first step. Rt was then used to simulate the epidemics across all major cities in China and typical countries worldwide. Results: Based on a total of 126 index-secondary cases pairs from 4 international regions, we estimated that the serial interval for SARS-2-CoV was 4.18 (IQR 1.92 - 6.65) days. Domestically, Rt of China, Hubei province, Wuhan had fallen below 1.0 on 9 Feb, 10 Feb and 13 Feb (Rt were 0.99 {+/-} 0.02, 0.99 {+/-} 0.02 and 0.96 {+/-} 0.02), respectively. Internationally, as of 26 Feb, statistically significant periods of COVID spread (Rt >1) were identified for most regions, except for Singapore (Rt was 0.92 {+/-} 0.17). Conclusions: The epidemic in China has been well controlled, but the worldwide pandemic has not been well controlled.

Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Evaluaci\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00b3n de intervenciones durante la pandemia COVID-19: desarrollo de un modelo basado en subpoblaciones con distintas tasas de contacto\nAlthough multiple attempts have been made to mathematically model the current epidemic of SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), few models have been conceived as accessible interactive tools for users from various backgrounds. The goal of this study was to develop a model that took into account the heterogeneity in contact rates within the population and to implement it in an accessible application allowing to estimate the impact of possible interventions based on available information. An extended version of the Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Resistant (SEIR) model, named SEIR-HL, was developed, assuming a population divided into two subpopulations, with different contact rates. Additionally, a formula for the calculation of the basic reproduction number ( R 0 ) for a population divided into n subpopulations was proposed, where the contact rates for each subpopulation can be distinguished according to contact type or context. The predictions made by SEIR-HL were compared to those of SEIR, showing that the heterogeneity in contact rates can dramatically affect the dynamics of simulations, even when run from the same initial conditions and with the same parameters. SEIR-HL was used to predict the effect on the epidemic evolution of the displacement of individuals from high-contact positions to low-contact positions. Lastly, by way of example, SEIR-HL was applied to the analysis of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in Argentina and an example of the application of the R 0 formula was also developed. Both the SEIR-HL model and an R 0 calculator were computerized and made available to the community.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: A simulation on potential secondary spread of novel coronavirus in an exported country using a stochastic epidemic seir model\nOngoing outbreak of pneumonia caused by novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) began in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, and the number of new patients continues to increase. Even though it began to spread to many other parts of the world, such as other Asian countries, the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East, the impact of secondary outbreaks caused by exported cases outside China remains unclear. We conducted simulations to estimate the impact of potential secondary outbreaks in a community outside China.

Understanding the role of host genetics in disease spread is important for developing disease control strategies that efficiently reduce infection incidence and risk of epidemics. While heritable variation in disease susceptibility has been targeted in livestock breeding, emerging evidence suggests that there is additional genetic variation in host infectivity, but the potential benefits of including infectivity into selection schemes are currently unknown. A Susceptible-Infected-Recovered epidemiological model incorporating polygenic genetic variation in both susceptibility and infectivity was combined with quantitative genetics selection theory to assess the non-linear impact of genetic selection on field measures of epidemic risk and severity. Response to 20 generations of selection was calculated in large simulated populations, exploring schemes differing in accuracy and intensity. Assuming moderate genetic variation in both traits, 50% selection on susceptibility required seven generations to reduce the basic reproductive number R(0) from 7.64 to the critical threshold of <1, below which epidemics die out. Adding infectivity in the selection objective accelerated the decline towards R(0) < 1, to 3 generations. Our results show that although genetic selection on susceptibility reduces disease risk and prevalence, the additional gain from selection on infectivity accelerates disease eradication and reduces more efficiently the risk of new outbreaks, while it alleviates delays generated by unfavourable correlations. In conclusion, host infectivity was found to be an important trait to target in future genetic studies and breeding schemes, to help reducing the occurrence and impact of epidemics.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Surgical Resection and Prognostic Analysis of 142 Cases of Hilar Cholangiocarcinoma\nSurgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma is the only curative option, but low resectability rate and poor survival outcomes remain a challenge. This study was to assess the surgical resection for hilar cholangiocarcinoma and analyze the prognostic factors influencing postoperative survival. One hundred forty-two patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma who underwent surgical resection between January 2006 and December 2014 were analyzed retrospectively based on clinicopathological and demographic data. Univariate and multivariate analysis against outcome were employed to identify potential factors affecting prognosis. Ninety-five patients were performed with R0 resection with median survival time of 22 months; whereas, 47 patients underwent non-R0 resection (R1 = 20, R2 = 27) with that of 10 months. Of these 95 patients, 19 underwent concomitant with vascular resection and reconstruction and 2 patients underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy. 64.8% patients (n = 92) underwent combined with hepatectomy. The one-year, three-year, and five-year survival rates after R0 resection were 76.3, 27.8, 11.3%, respectively, which was significantly better than that after non-curative resection (P = 0.000).

MethodsWe used a gaussian process to model incidence of infections and then estimated observed PCR prevalence by convolving our modelled incidence estimates with a previously published PCR detection curve describing the probability of a positive test as a function of the time since infection. We refined our incidence estimates using time-varying estimates of antibody prevalence combined with a model of antibody positivity and waning that moved individuals between compartments with or without antibodies based on estimates of new infections, vaccination, probability of seroconversion and waning. ResultsWe produced incidence curves of infection describing the UK epidemic from late April 2020 until early 2022. We used these estimates of incidence to estimate the time-varying growth rate of infections, and combined them with estimates of the generation interval to estimate time-varying reproduction numbers. Biological parameters describing seroconversion and waning, while based on a simple model, were broadly in line with plausible ranges from individual-level studies. ConclusionsBeyond informing situational awareness and allowing for estimates using individual-level data, repeated cross-sectional studies make it possible to estimate epidemiological parameters from population-level models. Studies or public health surveillance methods based on similar designs offer opportunities for further improving our understanding of the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 or other pathogens and their interaction with population-level immunity.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Assessing the Transmissibility of the New SARS-CoV-2 Variants: From Delta to Omicron\nOmicron, the latest SARS-CoV-2 Variant of Concern (VOC), first appeared in Africa in November 2021. At present, the question of whether a new VOC will out-compete the currently predominant variant is important for governments seeking to determine if current surveillance strategies and responses are appropriate and reasonable. Based on both virus genomes and daily-confirmed cases, we compare the additive differences in growth rates and reproductive numbers (R0) between VOCs and their predominant variants through a Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis. Faced with different variants, we evaluate the effects of current policies and vaccinations against VOCs and predominant variants. The model also predicts the date on which a VOC may become dominant based on simulation and real data in the early stage. The results suggest that the overall additive difference in growth rates of B.1.617.2 and predominant variants was 0.44 (95% confidence interval, 95% CI: \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.38, 1.25) in February 2021, and that the VOC had a relatively high R0. The additive difference in the growth rate of BA.1 in the United Kingdom was 6.82 times the difference between Delta and Alpha, and the model successfully predicted the dominating process of Alpha, Delta and Omicron. Current vaccination strategies remain similarly effective against Delta compared to the previous variants. Our model proposes a reliable Bayesian framework to predict the spread trends of VOCs based on early-stage data, and evaluates the effects of public health policies, which may help us better prepare for the upcoming Omicron variant, which is now spreading at an unprecedented speed.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Characterizing super-spreading events and age-specific infectivity of COVID-19 transmission in Georgia, USA\nAs the current COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact countries around the globe, refining our understanding of its transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of interventions is imperative. In particular, it is essential to obtain a firmer grasp on the effect of social distancing, potential individual-level heterogeneities in transmission such as age-specific infectivity, and impact of super-spreading. To this end, it is important to exploit multiple data streams that are becoming abundantly available during the pandemic. In this paper, we formulate an individual-level spatio-temporal mechanistic framework to statistically integrate case data with geo-location data and aggregate mobility data, enabling a more granular understanding of the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We analyze reported cases from surveillance data, between March and early May 2020, in five (urban and rural) counties in the State of Georgia USA. We estimate natural history parameters of COVID-19 and infer unobserved quantities including infection times and transmission paths using Bayesian data-augmentation techniques. First, our results show that the overall median reproductive number was 2.88 (with 95% C.I. [1.85, 4.9]) before the state-wide shelter-in-place order issued in early April, and the effective reproductive number was reduced to below 1 about two weeks by the order. Super-spreading appears to be widespread across space and time, and it may have a particularly important role in driving the outbreak in the rural area and increasing importance towards later stages of outbreaks in both urban and rural settings. Overall, about 2% of cases may have directly infected 20% of all infections. We estimate that the infected children and younger adults (<60 years old) may be 2.38 [1.30, 3.51] times more transmissible than infected elderly (>=60), and the former may be the main driver of super-spreading. Through the synthesis of multiple data streams using our transmission modelling framework, our results enforce and improve our understanding of the natural history and transmission dynamics of COVID-19. More importantly, we reveal the roles of age-specific infectivity and characterize systematic variations and associated risk factors of super-spreading. These have important implications for the planning of relaxing social distancing and, more generally, designing optimal control measures.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: The early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Lombardy, Italy\nBACKGROUND: In the night of February 20, 2020, the first epidemic of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outside Asia was uncovered by the identification of its first patient in Lombardy region, Italy. In the following weeks, Lombardy experienced a sudden increase in the number of ascertained infections and strict measures were imposed to contain the epidemic spread. METHODS: We analyzed official records of cases occurred in Lombardy to characterize the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 during the early phase of the outbreak. A line list of laboratory-confirmed cases was set up and later retrospectively consolidated, using standardized interviews to ascertained cases and their close contacts. We provide estimates of the serial interval, of the basic reproduction number, and of the temporal variation of the net reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2. RESULTS: Epidemiological investigations detected over 500 cases (median age: 69, IQR: 57\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015378) before the first COVID-19 diagnosed patient (February 20, 2020), and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 was already circulating in at least 222 out of 1506 (14.7%) municipalities with sustained transmission across all the Lombardy provinces. We estimated the mean serial interval to be 6.6 days (95% CrI, 0.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015319). Our estimates of the basic reproduction number range from 2.6 in Pavia (95% CI, 2.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.2) to 3.3 in Milan (95% CI, 2.9\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01533.8). A decreasing trend in the net reproduction number was observed following the detection of the first case. CONCLUSIONS: At the time of first case notification, COVID-19 was already widespread in the entire Lombardy region. This may explain the large number of critical cases experienced by this region in a very short timeframe. The slight decrease of the reproduction number observed in the early days after February 20, 2020 might be due to increased population awareness and early interventions implemented before the regional lockdown imposed on March 8, 2020.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Assessment of SARS-CoV-2 Screening Strategies to Permit the Safe Reopening of College Campuses in the United States\nImportance: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic poses an existential threat to many US residential colleges; either they open their doors to students in September or they risk serious financial consequences. Objective: To define severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) screening performance standards that would permit the safe return of students to US residential college campuses for the fall 2020 semester. Design, Setting, and Participants: This analytic modeling study included a hypothetical cohort of 4990 students without SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection at the start of the semester. The decision and cost-effectiveness analyses were linked to a compartmental epidemic model to evaluate symptom-based screening and tests of varying frequency (ie, every 1, 2, 3, and 7 days), sensitivity (ie, 70%-99%), specificity (ie, 98%-99.7%), and cost (ie, $10/test-$50/test). Reproductive numbers (Rt) were 1.5, 2.5, and 3.5, defining 3 epidemic scenarios, with additional infections imported via exogenous shocks. The model assumed a symptomatic case fatality risk of 0.05% and a 30% probability that infection would eventually lead to observable COVID-19-defining symptoms in the cohort. Model projections were for an 80-day, abbreviated fall 2020 semester. This study adhered to US government guidance for parameterization data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Cumulative tests, infections, and costs; daily isolation dormitory census; incremental cost-effectiveness; and budget impact. Results: At the start of the semester, the hypothetical cohort of 5000 students included 4990 (99.8%) with no SARS-CoV-2 infection and 10 (0.2%) with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Assuming an Rt of 2.5 and daily screening with 70% sensitivity, a test with 98% specificity yielded 162 cumulative student infections and a mean isolation dormitory daily census of 116, with 21 students (18%) with true-positive results. Screening every 2 days resulted in 243 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 76, with 28 students (37%) with true-positive results. Screening every 7 days resulted in 1840 cumulative infections and a mean daily isolation census of 121 students, with 108 students (90%) with true-positive results. Across all scenarios, test frequency was more strongly associated with cumulative infection than test sensitivity. This model did not identify symptom-based screening alone as sufficient to contain an outbreak under any of the scenarios we considered. Cost-effectiveness analysis selected screening with a test with 70% sensitivity every 2, 1, or 7 days as the preferred strategy for an Rt of 2.5, 3.5, or 1.5, respectively, implying screening costs of $470, $910, or $120, respectively, per student per semester. Conclusions and Relevance: In this analytic modeling study, screening every 2 days using a rapid, inexpensive, and even poorly sensitive (>70%) test, coupled with strict behavioral interventions to keep Rt less than 2.5, is estimated to maintain a controllable number of COVID-19 infections and permit the safe return of students to campus.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: The outbreak pattern of SARS cases in China as revealed by a mathematical model\nSince it first appeared in China's Guangdong Province, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) has caused serious damages to many parts of the world, especially Asia. Little is known about its epidemiology. We developed a modified discrete SIR model including susceptible individuals, non-hospitalized SARS persons; hospitalized patients, cured hospital patients, and those who have died due to SARS infection. Here, we demonstrate the effective reproduction number is determined by infection rates and infectious period of hospitalized and non-hospitalized SARS patients. Both infection rate and the effective reproductive number of the SARS virus are significantly negatively correlated with the total number of cumulative cases, indicating that the control measures implemented in China are effective, and the outbreak pattern of accumulative SARS cases in China is a logistic growth curve. We estimate the basic reproduction number R(0) of SARS virus is 2.87 in mainland of China, very close to the estimations in Singapore and Hong Kong.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Estimation of the Outbreak Severity and Evaluation of Epidemic Prevention Ability of COVID-19 by Province in China.\nObjectives. To compare the epidemic prevention ability of COVID-19 of each province in China and to evaluate the existing prevention and control capacity of each province.Methods. We established a quasi-Poisson linear mixed-effects model using the case data in cities outside Wuhan in Hubei Province, China. We adapted this model to estimate the number of potential cases in Wuhan and obtained epidemiological parameters. We estimated the initial number of cases in each province by using passenger flowrate data and constructed the extended susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model to predict the future disease transmission trends.Results. The estimated potential cases in Wuhan were about 3 times the reported cases. The basic reproductive number was 3.30 during the initial outbreak. Provinces with more estimated imported cases than reported cases were those in the surrounding provinces of Hubei, including Henan and Shaanxi. The regions where the number of reported cases was closer to the predicted value were most the developed areas, including Beijing and Shanghai.Conclusions. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan was underestimated in the initial period of the outbreak. Provincial surveillance and emergency response capabilities vary across the country.

Despite a rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the epidemic was stemmed via a combination of epidemic mitigation and control measures. This study evaluates how the implementation of clinical diagnostics and universal symptom surveys contributed to epidemic control in Wuhan. We extended the susceptibles-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) transmission dynamics model by considering three quarantined compartments (SEIR+Q). The SEIR+Q dynamics model was fitted using the daily reported number of confirmed infections and unconfirmed cases by clinical diagnostic criteria up to February 14, 2020 in Wuhan. Applying the model to carry forward the pre-February 14 trend in Wuhan, the number of daily new diagnosed cases would be expected to drop below 100 by March 25, below 10 by April 29, and reach 0 by May 31, 2020. The observed case counts after February 14 demonstrated that the daily new cases fell below 100 by March 6, below 10 by March 11, and reached 0 by March 18, or, respectively, 19, 49, and 74 d earlier than model predictions. By March 30, the observed number of cumulative confirmed cases was 50 006, which was 19 951 cases fewer than the predicted count. Effective reproductive number R(t) analysis using observed frequencies showed a remarkable decline after the implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys, which was significantly below the R(t) curve estimated by the model assuming that the pre-February 14 trend was carried forward. In conclusion, the proposed SEIR+Q dynamics model was a good fit for the epidemic data in Wuhan and explained the large increase in the number of infections during February 12-14, 2020. The implementation of clinical diagnostic criteria and universal symptom surveys contributed to a contraction in both the magnitude and the duration of the epidemic in Wuhan.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: 712 COVID-19 Risk Perception, Sleep Health and Peritraumatic Distress Among New Yorkers: The NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: Long-term exposure to pandemics like COVID-19 may increase psychological distress (e.g., peri-traumatic and post-traumatic distress) and sleep problems. Little is known about the effects of COVID-19 on peritraumatic distress, a well-documented risk factor for post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD). The aim of this study was to investigate the association between COVID-19 risk perception and peritraumatic distress, and whether this relationship is moderated by sleep quality among individuals located in NY. METHODS: We examined data from 541 individuals (69% were female, mean age (SD) = 40.9 (15.3)] recruited online during summer and fall 2020 in New York for the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Data were gathered on sociodemographic, COVID-19 risk perception (yes or no items), peri-traumatic distress measured by Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI), and sleep quality measured by the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Descriptive, regression analysis and interaction terms were conducted using SPSS v. 25 to examine associations between COVID-19 risk perception with symptoms of peritraumatic distress and sleep quality. RESULTS: Of the 541 participants, 311(57.5%) reported they felt at risk for contracting COVID-19. PSQI was positively correlated with PDI (r =.38, p =0.01). An independent sample t student test indicated, on average, that the symptoms of PDI [(mean (SD)=27.3 (7.63), t = 7.07, n =307)] and PSQI [mean(SD)=10.62(3.57), t=4.31 n=311)] of our participants who felt at risk for contracting the COVID-19 significantly exceeded those who did not [(PDI mean(SD)=22.7(7.13), n =228); PSQI (mean(SD) =9.25(3.72), n=229]. Results of multiple linear regression analysis shown that COVID-19 risk perception was the strongest predictor of PDI [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]. Furthermore, the interaction effect of PSQI scores and COVID-19 risk perception revealed that sleep quality significantly reduced the association between COVID-19 risk perception and PDI [B(t) = .319(5.71); p <.001], such that poorer sleep and feeling at risk of contracting COVID-19 resulted in more severe PDI scores. CONCLUSION: COVID-19 risk perception was associated with peritraumatic distress and poorer sleep quality, and sleep quality attenuated this relationship.

We report and contextualize epidemiological, demographic and clinical findings for COVID-19 cases during the first 3 months of the epidemic. By 31 May 2020, 514,200 COVID-19 cases, including 29,314 deaths, had been reported in 75.3% (4,196 of 5,570) of municipalities across all five administrative regions of Brazil. The R0 value for Brazil was estimated at 3.1 (95% Bayesian credible interval = 2.4-5.5), with a higher median but overlapping credible intervals compared with some other seriously affected countries. A positive association between higher per-capita income and COVID-19 diagnosis was identified. Furthermore, the severe acute respiratory infection cases with unknown aetiology were associated with lower per-capita income. Co-circulation of six respiratory viruses was detected but at very low levels. These findings provide a comprehensive description of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in Brazil and may help to guide subsequent measures to control virus transmission.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Simulating the progression of the COVID-19 disease in Cameroon using SIR models\nThis paper analyses the evolution of COVID 19 disease in Cameroon over the period March 6 April 2020 using SIR model.

Data used in this study is obtained from the Ministry of Health of Cameroon. The results suggest that over the period, the reproduction number of the COVID 19 in Cameroon is about 1.5 and the peak of the infection could occur at the end of May 2020 with about 7.7% of the population infected.

Despite reducing transmission, isolating close contacts can lead to high levels of absences, negatively impacting pupils. To quantify pupil-to-pupil SARS-CoV-2 transmission and the impact of implemented control measures, we fit a stochastic individual-based model of secondary school infection to both swab testing data and secondary school absences data from England, and then simulate outbreaks from 31st August 2020 until 23rd May 2021. We find that the pupil-to-pupil reproduction number, R(school), has remained below 1 on average across the study period, and that twice weekly mass testing using LFTs has helped to control pupil-to-pupil transmission. We also explore the potential benefits of alternative containment strategies, finding that a strategy of repeat testing of close contacts rather than isolation, alongside mass testing, substantially reduces absences with only a marginal increase in pupil-to-pupil transmission.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Controlling the Spread of COVID-19: Optimal Control Analysis\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2). It was declared on March 11, 2020, by the World Health Organization as pandemic disease. The disease has neither approved medicine nor vaccine and has made governments and scholars search for drastic measures in combating the pandemic. Regrettably, the spread of the virus and mortality due to COVID-19 has continued to increase daily. Hence, it is imperative to control the spread of the disease particularly using nonpharmacological strategies such as quarantine, isolation, and public health education. This work studied the effect of these different control strategies as time-dependent interventions using mathematical modeling and optimal control approach to ascertain their contributions in the dynamic transmission of COVID-19. The model was proven to have an invariant region and was well-posed. The basic reproduction number and effective reproduction numbers were computed with and without interventions, respectively, and were used to carry out the sensitivity analysis that identified the critical parameters contributing to the spread of COVID-19. The optimal control analysis was carried out using the Pontryagin's maximum principle to figure out the optimal strategy necessary to curtail the disease. The findings of the optimal control analysis and numerical simulations revealed that time-dependent interventions reduced the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. These interventions were time-bound and best implemented within the first 100 days of the outbreak. Again, the combined implementation of only two of these interventions produced a good result in reducing infection in the population. While, the combined implementation of all three interventions performed better, even though zero infection was not achieved in the population. This implied that multiple interventions need to be deployed early in order to reduce the virus to the barest minimum.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Report 21: Estimating COVID-19 cases and reproduction number in Brazil\nBrazil is an epicentre for COVID-19 in Latin America. In this report we describe the Brazilian epidemic using three epidemiological measures: the number of infections, the number of deaths and the reproduction number. Our modelling framework requires sufficient death data to estimate trends, and we therefore limit our analysis to 16 states that have experienced a total of more than fifty deaths. The distribution of deaths among states is highly heterogeneous, with 5 states---Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Ceara, Pernambuco and Amazonas---accounting for 81% of deaths reported to date. In these states, we estimate that the percentage of people that have been infected with SARS-CoV-2 ranges from 3.3% (95% CI: 2.8%-3.7%) in Sao Paulo to 10.6% (95% CI: 8.8%-12.1%) in Amazonas. The reproduction number (a measure of transmission intensity) at the start of the epidemic meant that an infected individual would infect three or four others on average. Following non-pharmaceutical interventions such as school closures and decreases in population mobility, we show that the reproduction number has dropped substantially in each state. However, for all 16 states we study, we estimate with high confidence that the reproduction number remains above 1. A reproduction number above 1 means that the epidemic is not yet controlled and will continue to grow. These trends are in stark contrast to other major COVID-19 epidemics in Europe and Asia where enforced lockdowns have successfully driven the reproduction number below 1. While the Brazilian epidemic is still relatively nascent on a national scale, our results suggest that further action is needed to limit spread and prevent health system overload.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: A Hybrid Approach Toward COVID-19 Pandemic Modeling in Saudi Arabia Using the Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered Model and Open Data Sources\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused the world to operate uncharacteristically for almost the last two years. Governments across the globe have taken different control measures to eradicate it. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) provides open access data for different countries on 20 control measures, including numerous aggregated indices. This paper employs the modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiology model to study the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. The modification has been achieved by including control measures and the infectiousness of exposed compartment. A hybrid approach has been used to estimate and incorporate control measures. Initially, a composite control measure has been derived from OxCGRT data to make an attempt to fit the COVID-19 pattern in Saudi Arabia. The derived model has proven to be satisfactory through statistical tests. Nonetheless, the model patterns do not resemble the reported patterns more closely. Hence, a second heuristic approach has been utilized to devise effective control measures from the reported pattern of COVID-19 from the Saudi government agency. A satisfactory model was derived utilizing this approach with successful validation through statistical tests. Also, the model patterns more closely resemble the reported patterns of COVID-19 cases. This hybrid approach proves more robust and ensures the validity of model parameters better. The R naught (R0) value with the current control measures has varied from 0.515 to 1.892, with a mean value of 1.119, and is presently less than 1. The threshold herd immunity, in the absence of any control measure, is estimated to be 47.12% with an R0 value of 1.89 and would end up infecting 76.32% of the population. The scenario analysis with gradual partial and complete relaxations up to December 31, 2021, shows that the peaks are likely to occur in 2022;therefore, Saudi Arabia must continue to inoculate its population to eradicate COVID-19.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Outbreak of COVID-19 and SARS in mainland China: a comparative study based on national surveillance data\nOBJECTIVE: To compare the epidemiological characteristics and transmission dynamics in relation to interventions against the COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in mainland China. DESIGN: Comparative study based on a unique data set of COVID-19 and SARS. SETTING: Outbreak in mainland China. PARTICIPANTS: The final database included 82 858 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 5327 cases of SARS. METHODS: We brought together all existing data sources and integrated them into a comprehensive data set. Individual information on age, sex, occupation, residence location, date of illness onset, date of diagnosis and clinical outcome was extracted. Control measures deployed in mainland China were collected. We compared the epidemiological and spatial characteristics of COVID-19 and SARS. We estimated the effective reproduction number to explore differences in transmission dynamics and intervention effects. RESULTS: Compared with SARS, COVID-19 affected more extensive areas (1668 vs 230 counties) within a shorter time (101 vs 193 days) and had higher attack rate (61.8 vs 4.0 per million persons). The COVID-19 outbreak had only one epidemic peak and one epicentre (Hubei Province), while the SARS outbreak resulted in two peaks and two epicentres (Guangdong Province and Beijing). SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect older people (median age of 52 years), while SARS-CoV tended to infect young adults (median age of 34 years). The case fatality rate (CFR) of either disease increased with age, but the CFR of COVID-19 was significantly lower than that of SARS (5.6% vs 6.4%). The trajectory of effective reproduction number dynamically changed in relation to interventions, which fell below 1 within 2 months for COVID-19 and within 5.5 months for SARS.

A valuable metric for assessing the current threat posed by an outbreak is the time-dependent reproduction number, i.e. the expected number of secondary cases caused by each infected individual. This quantity can be estimated using data on the numbers of observed new cases at successive times during an epidemic and the distribution of the serial interval (the time between symptomatic cases in a transmission chain). Some methods for estimating the reproduction number rely on pre-existing estimates of the serial interval distribution and assume that the entire outbreak is driven by local transmission. Here we show that accurate inference of current transmissibility, and the uncertainty associated with this estimate, requires: (i) up-to-date observations of the serial interval to be included, and; (ii) cases arising from local transmission to be distinguished from those imported from elsewhere. We demonstrate how pathogen transmissibility can be inferred appropriately using datasets from outbreaks of H1N1 influenza, Ebola virus disease and Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome. We present a tool for estimating the reproduction number in real-time during infectious disease outbreaks accurately, which is available as an R software package (EpiEstim 2.2). It is also accessible as an interactive, user-friendly online interface (EpiEstim App), permitting its use by non-specialists. Our tool is easy to apply for assessing the transmission potential, and hence informing control, during future outbreaks of a wide range of invading pathogens.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: COVID-19 data analysis and modeling in Palestine\nWe estimate an actual number of infected cases in Palestine based on the 18-day effect from infection to death. We find that the number of cases in April 22 varies between 506 and 2 026 infected cases. We also focus on the reproductive number in Palestine based on population dynamics with two SEIR models. Dataset is from 5 March to 22 April 2020. With a transmission rate equal to 4.55 106, on May 22, the simulations predict 11 014 total infected cases in the optimistic scenario and 113 171 in the worst one. The crest of the pandemic is from 22 to 27 May 2020. The reproductive number R0 is equal to 1.54 for a fixed fraction of 0.6 of symptomatic cases that are reported and for a removal rate of 7. Palestinian COVID-19 mortality number is equal to 6 per million. It is small compared to countries neighboring Palestine. The infected number is equal to 88.4 per million, which is less than most of its neighbors. The basic reproduction number is still greater than 1. Changes to the transmission rate (over time) would be advisable, to fall R0 below the critical threshold.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Time from symptom onset to hospitalisation of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) cases: Implications for the proportion of transmissions from infectors with few symptoms\nInterventions targeting symptomatic hosts and their contacts were successful in bringing the 2003 SARS pandemic under control. In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic has been harder to contain, partly because of its wide spectrum of symptoms in infectious hosts. Current evidence suggests that individuals can transmit the novel coronavirus while displaying few symptoms. Here, we show that the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms at the start of an outbreak can, in combination with the basic reproduction number, indicate whether or not interventions targeting symptomatic hosts are likely to be effective. However, as an outbreak continues, the proportion of infections arising from hosts with few symptoms changes in response to control measures. A high proportion of infections from hosts with few symptoms after the initial stages of an outbreak is only problematic if the rate of new infections remains high. Otherwise, it can simply indicate that symptomatic transmissions are being prevented successfully. This should be considered when interpreting estimates of the extent of transmission from hosts with few COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Transmission characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak in China: a study driven by data\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has been a serious public health threat worldwide. We use individually documented case descriptions of COVID-19 from China (excluding Hubei Province) to estimate the distributions of the generation time, incubation period, and periods from symptom onset to isolation and to diagnosis. The recommended 14-day quarantine period may lead to a 6.7% failure for quarantine. We recommend a 22-day quarantine period. The mean generation time is 3.3 days and the mean incubation period is 7.2 days. It took 3.7 days to isolate and 6.6 days to diagnose a patient after his/her symptom onset. Patients may become infectious on average 3.9 days before showing major symptoms. This makes contact tracing and quarantine ineffective. The basic reproduction number is estimated to be 1.54 with contact tracing, quarantine and isolation, mostly driven by super spreaders.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Tracking the emergence of disparities in the subnational spread of COVID-19 in Brazil using an online application for real-time data visualisation: A longitudinal analysis\nBackground Brazil is one of the countries worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic with over 20 million cases and 557,000 deaths reported by August 2021. Comparison of real-time local COVID-19 data between areas is essential for understanding transmission, measuring the effects of interventions, and predicting the course of the epidemic, but are often challenging due to different population sizes and structures. Methods We describe the development of a new app for the real-time visualisation of COVID-19 data in Brazil at the municipality level. In the CLIC-Brazil app, daily updates of case and death data are downloaded, age standardised and used to estimate the effective reproduction number (Rt). We show how such platforms can perform real-time regression analyses to identify factors associated with the rate of initial spread and early reproduction number. We also use survival methods to predict the likelihood of occurrence of a new peak of COVID-19 incidence. Findings After an initial introduction in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states in early March 2020, the epidemic spread to northern states and then to highly populated coastal regions and the Central-West. Municipalities with higher metrics of social development experienced earlier arrival of COVID-19 (decrease of 11\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b71 days [95% CI:8.9,13.2] in the time to arrival for each 10% increase in the social development index). Differences in the initial epidemic intensity (mean Rt) were largely driven by geographic location and the date of local onset. Interpretation This study demonstrates that platforms that monitor, standardise and analyse the epidemiological data at a local level can give useful real-time insights into outbreak dynamics that can be used to better adapt responses to the current and future pandemics.

We estimated case fatality rate, cumulative recovery number, basic reproduction number (R0) and future incidence of COVID-19 in Bangladesh. We illustrated the spatial distribution of cases throughout the country. We performed phylogenetic and mutation analysis of SARS-CoV-2 sequences from Bangladesh. As of July 31, 2020, Bangladesh had a case fatality rate of 1.32%. The cases were initially clustered in Dhaka and its surrounding districts in March but spreads throughout the country over time. The R0 calculated as 1.173 in Exponential Growth method. For the projection, a 20% change in R0 with subsequent infection trend has been calculated. The genomic analysis of 292 Bangladeshi SARS-CoV-2 strains suggests diverse genomic clades L, O, S, G, GH, where predominant circulating clade was GR (83.9%; 245/292). The GR clades' phylogenetic analysis revealed distinct clusters (I to XIII) with intra-clade variations. The mutation analysis revealed 1634 mutations where 94.6% and 5.4% were non-synonymous and unique mutation, respectively. The Spike, Nucleocapsid, NSP2, and RdRP showed substantially high mutation but no mutation was recorded in NSP9 and NSP11 protein. In spike (S) protein, 355 predominant mutations were recorded, highest in D614G. Alternatively, I120F in NSP2 protein, R203K and G204R in nucleocapsid protein, and P323L in RdRp were more recurrent. The Bangladeshi genomes belonged to phylogenetic lineages A, B, B.1, B.1.1, B.1.1.23, B.1.1.25, B.1.113, and B.1.36, among which 50.0% sequences owned by the pangolin lineage B.1.1.25. The study illustrates the spatial distribution of SARS-CoV-2, and molecular epidemiology of Bangladeshi isolates. We recommend continuous monitoring of R0 and genomic surveillance to understand the transmission dynamics and detect new variants of SARS-CoV-2 for proper control of the current pandemic and evaluate the effectiveness of vaccination globally.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Estimation of the Distribution of the Individual Reproduction Number: The Case of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nWe investigate the problem of estimating the distribution of the individual reproduction number governing the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the assumption that this random variable follows a Negative Binomial distribution, we focus on constructing estimators of the parameters of this distribution using reported infection data and taking into account issues like under-reporting or the time behavior of the infection and of the reporting processes. To this end, we extract information from regionally dissaggregated data reported by German health authorities, in order to estimate not only the mean but also the variance of the distribution of the individual reproduction number. In contrast to the mean, the latter parameter also depends on the unknown under-reporting rate of the pandemic. The estimates obtained allow not only for a better understanding of the time-varying behavior of the expected value of the individual reproduction number but also of its dispersion, for the construction of bootstrap confidence intervals and for a discussion of the implications of different policy interventions. Our methodological investigations are accompanied by an empirical study of the development of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, which shows a strong overdispersion of the individual reproduction number.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Effects of voluntary event cancellation and school closure as countermeasures against COVID-19 outbreak in Japan\nBACKGROUND: To control the COVID-19 outbreak in Japan, sports and entertainment events were canceled and schools were closed throughout Japan from February 26 through March 19. That policy has been designated as voluntary event cancellation and school closure (VECSC). OBJECT: This study assesses VECSC effectiveness based on predicted outcomes. METHODS: A simple susceptible\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153infected\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153recovered model was applied to data of patients with symptoms in Japan during January 14 through March 26. The respective reproduction numbers for periods before VECSC (R(0)), during VECSC (R(e)), and after VECSC (R(a)) were estimated. RESULTS: Results suggest R(0) before VECSC as 2.534 [2.449, 2.598], R(e) during VECSC as 1.077 [0.948, 1.228], and R(a) after VECSC as 4.455 [3.615, 5.255]. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Results demonstrated that VECSC can reduce COVID-19 infectiousness considerably, but after VECSC, the value of the reproduction number rose to exceed 4.0.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Trends of Epidemiological and Demographic Indicators of COVID-19 in India\nINTRODUCTION: This study was planned to assess the trends of epidemiological indicators and demographic determinants related to the COVID-19 in India. METHODOLOGY: This was a descriptive analysis of the COVID-19 cases and their outcomes between 1st March to 31st May 2020 in India. Unpaired t-test and ANOVA were used to determine the statistical differences. Linear regression models were prepared to estimate the effect of testing on the fatalities. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)/Case Fatality Rate (CFR), doubling time, and Basic Reproduction Number (R0) per week were calculated. RESULTS: Two-thirds of the cases were between 21-50 years of age, while three-fourth of deaths were among people above 50-years of age. The mean age of people infected with COVID-19 was declining throughout the study period. The mean age of infected males and females was significantly different. The male-female ratio of both infection and deaths due to COVID-19 was near about 2:1. IFR/CFR was 3.31 (95% CI = 3.13-3.50) in April, which reduced to 2.84 (95% CI = 2.77-2.92) in May. An incremental trend was observed in the recovery rates (9.42% to 48.18%), tests conducted / million population (12 / million to 2708 / million) and doubling time (3.59 to 17.71 days). The number of tests was significantly influencing the fatalities (?? = 0.016, 95% CI = 0.012-0.020). The overall R0 was found to be 1.72. CONCLUSIONS: Public health interventions were likely effective in containing the spread of COVID-19. There is a need to further improve the testing capacity. The high-risk category of individuals being prioritized for hospital admission should be redefined to include individuals older than 50 years.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: An analysis of contact tracing protocol in an over-dispersed SEIQR Covid-like disease\nThe aim of this work is to study an over-dispersed SEIQR infectious disease and obtain optimal methods of contact tracing. A prototypical example of such a disease is that of the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. In consequence, this study is immediately applicable to the current health crisis. In this paper, we introduce both a discrete and continuous model for various modes of contact tracing. From the continuous model, we derive a basic reproductive number and study the stability of the equilibrium points. We also implement the continuous and discrete models numerically and further analyze the effectiveness of different types of contact tracing and their cost on society. Additionally, through these simulations, we also study the effect that various parameters of the disease have on its evolution.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Role of antibodies, inflammatory markers, and echocardiographic findings in post-acute cardiopulmonary symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection\nBACKGROUNDShortness of breath, chest pain, and palpitations occur as post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC), but whether symptoms are associated with echocardiographic abnormalities, cardiac biomarkers, or markers of systemic inflammation remains unknown. METHODSIn a cross-sectional analysis, we assessed symptoms, performed echocardiograms, and measured biomarkers among adults >8 weeks after PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. We modeled associations between symptoms and baseline characteristics, echocardiographic findings, and biomarkers using logistic regression. RESULTSWe enrolled 102 participants at a median 7.2 months (IQR 4.1-9.1) following COVID-19 onset; 47 individuals reported dyspnea, chest pain, or palpitations. Median age was 52 years (range 24-86) and 41% were women. Female sex (OR 2.55, 95%CI 1.13-5.74) and hospitalization during acute infection (OR 3.25, 95%CI 1.08-9.82) were associated with symptoms. IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (OR 1.38 per doubling, 95%CI 1.38-1.84) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (OR 1.31 per doubling, 95%CI 1.00-1.71) were associated with symptoms. Regarding echocardiographic findings, 4/47 (9%) with symptoms had pericardial effusions compared to 0/55 without symptoms (p=0.038); those with pericardial effusions had a median 4 symptoms compared to 1 without (p<0.001). There was no strong evidence for a relationship between symptoms and echocardiographic functional parameters (including left ventricular ejection fraction and strain, right ventricular strain, pulmonary artery pressure) or high-sensitivity troponin, NT-pro-BNP, interleukin-10, interferon-gamma, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha. CONCLUSIONSAmong adults in the post-acute phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies, markers of inflammation and, possibly, pericardial effusions are associated with cardiopulmonary symptoms. Investigation into inflammation as a mechanism underlying PASC is warranted.

The contact process is a model for an epidemic spreading without permanent immunity that has an absorbing state. For finite lattices, the absorbing state is the true stationary state, which leads to the need for simulation of quasi-stationary states, which we did in two ways: reactivation by inserting spontaneous infected individuals, or by the quasi-stationary method, where we store a list of active states to continue the simulation when the system visits the absorbing state. The system presents an absorbing phase transition where the critical behavior obeys the Mean Field exponents $\\beta=1$, $\\gamma'=0$, and $\\nu=2$. However, the different quasi-stationary states present distinct finite-size logarithmic corrections. We also report the critical thresholds of the model as a linear function of the network connectivity inverse $1/z$, and the extrapolation of the critical threshold function for $z \\to \\infty$ yields the basic reproduction number $R_0=1$ of the complete graph, as expected. Decreasing the network connectivity leads to the increase of the critical basic reproduction number $R_0$ for this model.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: HERD IMMUNITY to SARS-CoV-2 among the POPULATION of the REPUBLIC of BELARUS AMID the COVID-19 PANDEMIC\nThe Bioethics Committee of Belarus and the local ethics committee of the St. Petersburg Pasteur Institute approved the study. Selection of participants was carried out using a questionnaire method and online technology (internet, cloud server). Volunteers were randomized into seven age groups (years of age): 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317;18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329;30\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339;40\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349;50\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015359;60\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015369;and 70+. Regional randomization ensured proportional representation of volunteers from each region, and no more than 30 people were included from one enterprise. In accordance with manufacturer instructions, blood plasma samples were analyzed for: IgG antibodies (Abs) to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (Nc) using a quantitative ELISA test system;and IgG Abs to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 S (spike) surface glycoprotein using a qualitative ELISA test system. Statistical processing was carried out using Excel 2010 and other software. Statistical differences were designated as significant when p < 0.05, unless otherwise indicated. Results. The level of seroprevalence, in terms of Abs to Nc among the Belarusian population, was 38.4% (95% CI 37.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015345.4). The highest Ab levels were found among individuals in older age groups (50-70+ years old). The lowest were found in children 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old and in young people 18\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015339 years old The distribution of seroprevalence across Belarusian regions was relatively homogeneous, with the exception of the Minsk Region, where a statistically significant decrease in the indicator was noted. In terms of profession, the largest share of seropositive individuals was found among transportation workers;the smallest was found in business. The moderate COVID-19 incidence has not led to a dramatic increase in the number of contacts. The base reproduction number (R0) was 1.3. In the Republic of Belarus, there was a moderate level of asymptomatic COVID-19 among seropositive individuals (45.3% [95% CI 44.0\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015346.7]). This form of infection was observed most often among children aged 1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015317 years old (65.0% [95% CI 61.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015368.6]). In parallel with seroprevalence assessment, SARS-CoV-2 vaccination was carried out. We used two vaccines: Gam-COVID-Vac (also known as Sputnik V, developed by Gamaleya National Center for Epidemiology and Microbiology, Russia);and BBIBP-CorV (Sinopharm, PRC). Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 was accompanied by an increase in the level of anti-RBD Abs (95% [95% CI 94.7\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015396.7]). Taking into account the vaccination of a subset of the population with BBIBP-CorV, the overall herd immunity, inferred from the analyzed indicators (presence of anti-Nc or anti-RBD Abs), was 47.1% (95% CI 46.3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015348.0). Conclusion. COVID-19 in Belarus was characterized by a moderately pronounced course of the epidemic process. The threshold level of herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached, as a result of which the conditions for progression of the epidemic remain.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Impact of the Tier system on SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns\nObjective: Measure the effects of the Tier system on the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK between the first and second national lockdowns, before the emergence of the B.1.1.7 variant of concern. Design: Modelling study combining estimates of the real-time reproduction number Rt (derived from UK case, death and serological survey data) with publicly available data on regional non-pharmaceutical interventions. We fit a Bayesian hierarchical model with latent factors using these quantities, to account for broader national trends in addition to subnational effects from Tiers. Setting: The UK at Lower Tier Local Authority (LTLA) level. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Reduction in real-time reproduction number Rt. Results: Nationally, transmission increased between July and late September, regional differences notwithstanding. Immediately prior to the introduction of the tier system, Rt averaged 1.3 (0.9-1.6) across LTLAs, but declined to an average of 1.1 (0.86-1.42) two weeks later. Decline in transmission was not solely attributable to Tiers. Tier 1 had negligible effects. Tiers 2 and 3 respectively reduced transmission by 6% (5%-7%) and 23% (21%-25%). 93% of LTLAs would have begun to suppress their epidemics if every LTLA had gone into Tier 3 by the second national lockdown, whereas only 29% did so in reality. Conclusions: The relatively small effect sizes found in this analysis demonstrate that interventions at least as stringent as Tier 3 are required to suppress transmission, especially considering more transmissible variants, at least until effective vaccination is widespread or much greater population immunity has amassed.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: The tiered restrictions enforced in November 2020 did not impact the epidemiology of the second wave of COVID-19 in Italy.\nIn the attempt to counter the second COVID-19 wave in autumn 2020, the Italian government introduced a unique countrywide system of physical distancing measures organized in progressively restrictive tiers (coded as yellow, orange, and red) imposed on a regional basis according to epidemiological risk assessments. This followed a set of other scattered or limited measures described in full detail by Manica et al.1. This paper concerns the introduction of the tiered restrictions. The data used to evaluate the impact of the restriction system on SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility and hospitalization burden in Italy is from the Italian COVID-19 integrated surveillance system. The reproduction number R(t) estimated on the onset of COViD-19 symptoms constantly decreased during most of the observation period 04 October 2020 - 06 December 2020 than is centered on the date of introduction of the measures and includes the expected latency to reach an effect. The fastest decrease of R(t) occurred in the period preceding the introduction of the tiered restrictions. There was no evidence that introducing the tiered restrictions determined the reduction of R(t). An alternative analysis using the daily growth rate of the epidemic curve confirms these conclusions. Similar considerations are made concerning the health system burden, analyzing hospitalizations at country level. The trend of R(t) tending to increase shortly after the measures became effective does not allow to exclude that the enforcement of such restrictions might have been counterproductive. These results are instrumental in informing public health efforts aimed at attempting to manage the epidemic efficiently. Planning further use of the tiered restrictions and the associated containment measures should be carefully and critically revised to avoid a useless burden to the population with no advantage for the containment of the epidemic or a possible worsening.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Effectiveness of interventions to reduce COVID-19 transmission in a large urban jail: a model-based analysis\nOBJECTIVES: We aim to estimate the impact of various mitigation strategies on COVID-19 transmission in a US jail beyond those offered in national guidelines. DESIGN: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19. SETTING: One anonymous large urban US jail. PARTICIPANTS: Several thousand staff and incarcerated individuals. INTERVENTIONS: There were four intervention phases during the outbreak: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells and asymptomatic testing. These interventions were implemented incrementally and in concert with one another. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The basic reproduction ratio, R 0 , in each phase, as estimated using the next generation method. The fraction of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths averted by these interventions (along with the standard measures of sanitisation, masking and social distancing interventions). RESULTS: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R 0 was 8.44 (95% credible interval (CrI): 5.00 to 13.10), and for the subsequent phases, R 0,phase 2 =3.64 (95% CrI: 2.43 to 5.11), R 0,phase 3 =1.72 (95% CrI: 1.40 to 2.12) and R 0,phase 4 =0.58 (95% CrI: 0.43 to 0.75). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases, hospitalisations and deaths over 83 days. CONCLUSIONS: Depopulation, single celling and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Decision makers should prioritise reductions in the jail population, single celling and testing asymptomatic populations as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Social, economic, and environmental factors influencing the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 across countries\nOBJECTIVE: To assess whether the basic reproduction number (R(0)) of COVID-19 is different across countries and what national-level demographic, social, and environmental factors other than interventions characterize initial vulnerability to the virus. METHODS: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak, for 58 countries for which 16 explanatory covariates are available. This fitting has been shown to robustly estimate R(0) from the specified period. We then use a generalized additive model (GAM) to discern both linear and nonlinear effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R(0). FINDINGS: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea).

An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R(0), (n-shape relationships), while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R(0). Pollution, temperature, and humidity did not have strong relationships with R(0) but were positive. CONCLUSION: Countries have different characteristics that predispose them to greater intrinsic vulnerability to COVID-19. Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions across locations should account for these baseline differences in social and demographic characteristics.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: A variational model for computing the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2\nWe propose a variational model for computing the effective reproduction number (ERN) of SARS-CoV-2 from the daily count of incident cases. This computation only requires the knowledge of the serial interval. The ERN estimate is made through the minimization of a functional that includes: (i) the adjustment of the incidence curve using an epidemiological model, (ii) the regularity of the estimation of the ERN and, (iii) the adjustment of the initial value to an initial estimate of R_0 obtained from the initial exponential growth of the epidemic. The model does not assume any statistical distribution for the ERN and, more importantly, does not require truncating the serial interval when its distribution contains negative days. A comparative study has been carried out with the standard EpiEstim method. For a particular choice of the parameters of the variational model and of the serial interval, a good agreement has been obtained between the estimate provided by the variational model and a 7 days shifted estimate obtained by EpiEstim. This backward shift suggests that our estimate is closer to present than that of EpiEstim. We also examine how to forecast the value of the ERN and the number of infected in the short term by two different extrapolation techniques. An implementation of the model is available online at www.ipol.im/ern.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: The impact of early social distancing at COVID-19 Outbreak in the largest Metropolitan Area of Brazil.\nWe evaluated the impact of early social distancing on the COVID-19 transmission in the Sao Paulo metropolitan area.

We analyzed 564 genomes deposited to GISAID database from various states of India. Pangolin COVID-19 Lineage Assigner tool was used to determine lineage assignment of all retrieved genomes. A Maximum likelihood (MLE) tree construction further confirms the separation of genomes into two distinct clades, BA. 1. and BA. 2. A very high reproduction number (R0) of 2.445 was estimated for the lineage BA.2. The highest R0 value in Telangana confirms the prevalence of lineage BA.2 in the state. Construction of the Reduced Median (RM) network shows evolution of some autochthonous haplogroups and haplotypes, which further supports the rapid evolution of omicron as compared to its previous variants. Phylogenomic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) and RM show the potential for the emergence of sub-sublineages and novel haplogroups respectively. Due to the recombinant property and high transmissibility of omicron virus, we suggest continuous and more widespread genome sequencing in all states of India to track evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in real time.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Nursing Home Design and COVID-19: Implications for Guidelines and Regulation\nObjectives Nursing homes (NHs) are important health care and residential environments for the growing number of frail older adults. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the vulnerability of NHs as they became COVID-19 hotspots. This study examines the associations of NH design with COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility, and provides relevant design recommendations. Design A cross-sectional, nationwide study was conducted after combining multiple national datasets about NHs. Setting and Participants A total of 7,785 NHs were included in the study, which represent 50.8% of all Medicare and/or Medicaid NH providers in the US. Methods Zero-inflated negative binomial models were used to predict the total number of COVID-19 resident cases and deaths, separately. The basic reproduction number (R0) was calculated for each NH to reflect the transmissibility of COVID-19 among residents within the facility, and a linear regression model was estimated to predict Log(R0-1). Predictors of these models included community factors and NHs\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 resident characteristics, management and rating factors, and physical environmental features. Results Increased share of private rooms, larger living area per bed, and presence of a ventilator dependent unit are significantly associated with reductions in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and transmissibility among residents. Increased number of certified beds in the NH is associated with reduced resident cases and deaths, after setting the number of actual residents as the exposure variable and controlling for staff cases. It also correlates with reduced transmissibility among residents when other risk factors, including staff cases, are controlled. Conclusions and Implications Architectural design attributes have significant impacts on COVID-19 transmissions in NHs. Considering the vulnerability of NH residents in congregated living environments, NHs will continue to be high-risk settings for infection outbreaks. To improve safety and resilience of NHs against future health disasters, facility guidelines and regulations should consider the need to increase private rooms and living areas.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Mobile learning acceptance and use in higher education during social distancing circumstances: an expansion and customization of UTAUT2\nPurpose - This paper investigates if the existing degree of students' acceptance and use of mobile or m-learning may face the online shift determined by SARS-CoV-2. Based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2), a new comprehensive model, SD-UTAUT (social distancing-UTAUT), is developed to better understand relationships between the original constructs, plus personal innovativeness (PI) and information quality (IQ). It identifies the key factors affecting behavioral intention (BI) and use by examining the influence of revaluated hedonic motivation (HM) and learning value (LV) importance as mediators. Design/methodology/approach - The paper opted for an exploratory study involving 311 learners, using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings - SD-UTAUT can be a new m-learning model in higher education. It has high predictive power and confirmed 15 out of 16 hypotheses. The most powerful relationship is between performance expectancy (PE) and HM. IQ affected LV the most, since HM the behavioral use (BU). HM impacts the use behavior (UB) more than LV, but habit (HT) affects it the most. Research limitations/implications - Because of the pandemic context, output may lack generalizability and reproducibility. Practical implications - To improve usage, staff must provide better support, course creators emphasize the objectives and competencies and developers integrate innovation. The joy and pleasure of m-learning use may stimulate the LV through interesting and interactive content, like incorporating gamification. Originality/value - The model set-up and circumstances are previously unseen. SD-UTAUT confirms ten new hypotheses and introduces the student's grade point average (GPA) as a moderator.

The second wave of infections broke out in late February and grew rapidly in the first 3 weeks. Authorities in the country responded quickly with a series of control strategies collectively known as the Movement Control Order (MCO) with different levels of intensity matching the progression of the epidemic. We examined the characteristics of the second wave and discussed the key control strategies implemented in the country. In the second wave, the epidemic doubled in size every 3.8 days (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.3, 4.5) in the first month and decayed slowly after that with a halving time of approximately 3 weeks. The time-varying reproduction number Rt peaked at 3.1 (95% credible interval: 2.7, 3.5) in the 3rd week, declined sharply thereafter and stayed below 1 in the last 3 weeks of April, indicating low transmissibility approximately 3 weeks after the MCO. Experience of the country suggests that adaptive triggering of distancing policies combined with a population-wide movement control measure can be effective in suppressing transmission and preventing a rebound.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: The effects of the clinical symptoms pneumonia-confirmation strategy of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China\nMotivated by the quick control in Wuhan, China, and the rapid spread in other countries of COVID-19, we investigate the questions that what is the turning point in Wuhan by quantifying the variety of basic reproductive number after the lockdown city. The answer may help the world to control the COVID-19 epidemic. A modified SEIR model is used to study the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan city. Our model is calibrated by the hospitalized cases. The modeling result gives out that the means of basic reproductive numbers are 1.5517 (95% CI 1.1716-4.4283) for the period from Jan 25 to Feb 11, 2020, and 0.4738(95% CI 0.0997-0.8370) for the period from Feb 12 to Mar 10.

We discovered that a lysine- and arginine-specific supramolecular ligand (CLR01) destroys enveloped viruses, including HIV, Ebola, and Zika virus, and remodels amyloid fibrils in semen that promote viral infection. Yet, it is unknown how CLR01 exerts these two distinct therapeutic activities. Here, we delineate a novel mechanism of antiviral activity by studying the activity of tweezer variants: the \"phosphate tweezer\" CLR01, a \"carboxylate tweezer\" CLR05, and a \"phosphate clip\" PC. Lysine complexation inside the tweezer cavity is needed to antagonize amyloidogenesis and is only achieved by CLR01. Importantly, CLR01 and CLR05 but not PC form closed inclusion complexes with lipid head groups of viral membranes, thereby altering lipid orientation and increasing surface tension. This process disrupts viral envelopes and diminishes infectivity but leaves cellular membranes intact. Consequently, CLR01 and CLR05 display broad antiviral activity against all enveloped viruses tested, including herpesviruses, Measles virus, influenza, and SARS-CoV-2. Based on our mechanistic insights, we potentiated the antiviral, membrane-disrupting activity of CLR01 by introducing aliphatic ester arms into each phosphate group to act as lipid anchors that promote membrane targeting. The most potent ester modifications harbored unbranched C4 units, which engendered tweezers that were approximately one order of magnitude more effective than CLR01 and nontoxic. Thus, we establish the mechanistic basis of viral envelope disruption by specific tweezers and establish a new class of potential broad-spectrum antivirals with enhanced activity.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Impact of reproduction number on multiwave spreading dynamics of COVID-19 with temporary immunity: a mathematical model\nOBJECTIVES: The recent discoveries of phylogenetically confirmed COVID-19 reinfection cases worldwide, together with studies suggesting that antibody titres decrease over time, raise the question of what course the epidemic trajectories may take if immunity were really to be temporary in a significant fraction of the population. The objective of this study is to answer this question. METHODS: We construct a ground-up delay differential equation model tailored to incorporate different kinds of immune response. We consider two immune responses here : (a) short-lived immunity of all kinds, and (b) short-lived sterilizing immunity with durable severity-reducing immunity. RESULTS: Multiple wave solutions to the model are manifest for intermediate values of the reproduction number R; interestingly, for sufficiently low as well as sufficiently high R, we find conventional single-wave solutions despite the temporary immunity. CONCLUSIONS: The versatility of our model and its very modest demands on computational resources ensure that a set of disease trajectories can be computed virtually on the same day that a new and relevant immune response study is released. Our work can also be used to analyse the disease dynamics after a vaccine is certified for use and information regarding its immune response becomes available.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: MATHEMATICAL PREDICTIONS FOR COVID-19 AS A GLOBAL PANDEMIC\nThis study shows that the disease free equilibrium (E_0 ) for COVID-19 coronavirus does not satisfy the criteria for a locally or globally asymptotic stability.

To study the effect of social distancing measure, we considered a new mathematical model on COVID-19 that incorporates lockdown effect. By validating our model to the data on notified cases from five different states and overall India, we estimated several epidemiologically important parameters as well as the basic reproduction number (R(0)). Combining the mechanistic mathematical model with different statistical forecast models, we projected notified cases in the six locations for the period May 17, 2020, till May 31, 2020. A global sensitivity analysis is carried out to determine the correlation of two epidemiologically measurable parameters on the lockdown effect and also on R(0). Our result suggests that lockdown will be effective in those locations where a higher percentage of symptomatic infection exists in the population. Furthermore, a large scale COVID-19 mass testing is required to reduce community infection. Ensemble model forecast suggested a high rise in the COVID-19 notified cases in most of the locations in the coming days. Furthermore, the trend of the effective reproduction number (R(t)) during the projection period indicates if the lockdown measures are completely removed after May 17, 2020, a high spike in notified cases may be seen in those locations.

This study developed a dynamic transmission model to investigate the impact of social media, particularly tweets via the social networking platform, Twitter on the number of influenza and COVID-19 cases of infection and deaths. We modified the traditional Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR-V) model with an additional social media component, in order to increase the accuracy of transmission dynamics and gain insight on whether social media is a beneficial behavioral intervention for these infectious diseases. The analysis found that social media has a positive effect in mitigating the spread of contagious disease in terms of peak time, peak magnitude, total infected, and total death; and the results also showed that social media's effect has a non-linear relationship with the reproduction number R 0 and it will be amplified when a vaccine is available.

METHODS: This study applied a mathematical model to estimate the increase in the number of cases in S\u00c3\u0192\u00c2\u00a3o Paulo state, Brazil during four epidemic periods and the subsequent 300 days. We used different types of dynamic transmission models to measure the effects of social distancing interventions, based on local contact patterns. Specifically, we used a model that incorporated multiple transmission pathways and an environmental class that represented the pathogen concentration in the environmental reservoir and also considered the time that an individual may sustain a latent infection before becoming actively infectious. Thus, this model allowed us to show how the individual quarantine and active monitoring of contacts can influence the model parameters and change the rate of exposure of susceptible individuals to those who are infected. RESULTS: The estimated basic reproductive number, R o , was 3.59 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.48 - 3.72). The mathematical model data prediction coincided with the real data mainly when the social distancing measures were respected. However, a lack of social distancing measures caused a significant increase in the number of infected individuals. Thus, if social distancing measures are not respected, we estimated a difference of at least 100,000 cases over the next 300 days. CONCLUSIONS: Although the predictive capacity of this model was limited by the accuracy of the available data, our results showed that social distancing is currently the best non-pharmacological measure.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: High Contagiousness and Rapid Spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic.

Since the emergence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, more than 1,300 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections have been reported in Asia, North Africa, and Europe by July 2015. The recent MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak in South Korea quickly became the second largest such outbreak with 186 total cases and 36 deaths in a little more than one month, second only to Saudi Arabia in country-specific number of reported cases. Methods. We use a simple mathematical model, the Richards model, to trace the temporal course of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak. We pinpoint its outbreak turning point and its transmissibility via basic reproduction number R(0) in order to ascertain the occurrence of this nosocomial outbreak and how it was quickly brought under control. Results. The estimated outbreak turning point of t(i) = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324.0]), or 23\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015324 days after the onset date of the index case on May 11, pinpoints June 3\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date.

The turning point of the South Korea MERS-CoV outbreak occurred around May 27\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015329, when control measures were quickly implemented after laboratory confirmation of the first cluster of nosocomial infections by the index patient. Furthermore, transmissibility of MERS-CoV in the South Korea outbreak was significantly higher than those reported from past MERS-CoV outbreaks in the Middle East, which is attributable to the nosocomial nature of this outbreak. Our estimate of R(0) for the South Korea MERS-CoV nosocomial outbreak further highlights the importance and the risk involved in cluster infections and superspreading events in crowded settings such as hospitals. Similar to the 2003 SARS epidemic, outbreaks of infectious diseases with low community transmissibility like MERS-CoV could still occur initially with large clusters of nosocomial infections, but can be quickly and effectively controlled with timely intervention measures.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Estimating the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in England, using weekly contact survey data\nBACKGROUND: Schools were closed in England on 4 January 2021 as part of increased national restrictions to curb transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The UK government reopened schools on 8 March. Although there was evidence of lower individual-level transmission risk amongst children compared to adults, the combined effects of this with increased contact rates in school settings and the resulting impact on the overall transmission rate in the population were not clear. METHODS: We measured social contacts of > 5000 participants weekly from March 2020, including periods when schools were both open and closed, amongst other restrictions. We combined these data with estimates of the susceptibility and infectiousness of children compared with adults to estimate the impact of reopening schools on the reproduction number. RESULTS: Our analysis indicates that reopening all schools under the same measures as previous periods that combined lockdown with face-to-face schooling would be likely to increase the reproduction number substantially. Assuming a baseline of 0.8, we estimated a likely increase to between 1.0 and 1.5 with the reopening of all schools or to between 0.9 and 1.2 reopening primary or secondary schools alone. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that reopening schools would likely halt the fall in cases observed between January and March 2021 and would risk a return to rising infections, but these estimates relied heavily on the latest estimates or reproduction number and the validity of the susceptibility and infectiousness profiles we used at the time of reopening.

Asymptomatic carriers of the virus display no clinical symptoms but are known to be contagious. Recent evidence reveals that this sub-population, as well as persons with mild, represent a major contributor in the propagation of COVID-19. The asymptomatic sub-population frequently escapes detection by public health surveillance systems. Because of this, the currently accepted estimates of the basic reproduction number (Ro) of the virus are inaccurate. It is unlikely that a pathogen can blanket the planet in three months with an Ro in the vicinity of 3, as reported in the literature. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical model taking into account asymptomatic carriers. Our results indicate that an initial value of the effective reproduction number could range from 5.5 to 25.4, with a point estimate of 15.4, assuming mean parameters. The first three weeks of the model exhibit exponential growth, which is in agreement with average case data collected from thirteen countries with universal health care and robust communicable disease surveillance systems; the average rate of growth in the number of reported cases is 23.3% per day during this period.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Transmission dynamics and successful control measures of SARS-CoV-2 in the mega-size city of Guangzhou, China.\nABSTRACT The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused a worldwide pandemic. Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control).We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1.Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3.Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Mathematical Modeling of Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 Dynamics using CF and ABC Non-Singular Fractional Derivatives\nIn this article, Coronavirus Disease COVID-19 transmission dynamics were studied to examine the utility of the SEIR compartmental model, using two non-singular kernel fractional derivative operators. This method was used to evaluate the complete memory effects within the model. The Caputo-Fabrizio (CF) and Atangana-Baleanu models were used predicatively, to demonstrate the possible long-term trajectories of COVID-19. Thus, the expression of the basic reproduction number using the next generating matrix was derived. We also investigated the local stability of the equilibrium points. Additionally, we examined the existence and uniqueness of the solution for both extensions of these models. Comparisons of these two epidemic modeling approaches (i.e. CF and ABC fractional derivative) illustrated that, for non-integer &#964; value. The ABC approach had a significant effect on the dynamics of the epidemic and provided new perspective for its utilization as a tool to advance research in disease transmission dynamics for critical COVID-19 cases. Concurrently, the CF approach demonstrated promise for use in mild cases. Furthermore, the integer &#964; value results of both approaches were identical.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Transmission patterns of COVID-19 in the mainland of China and the efficacy of different control strategies: a data- and model-driven study\nBACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has seriously endangered the health and lives of Chinese people. In this study, we predicted the COVID-19 epidemic trend and estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies in the mainland of China. METHODS: According to the COVID-19 epidemic status, we constructed a compartmental model. Based on reported data from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China during January 10-February 17, 2020, we estimated the model parameters. We then predicted the epidemic trend and transmission risk of COVID-19. Using a sensitivity analysis method, we estimated the efficacy of several intervention strategies. RESULTS: The cumulative number of confirmed cases in the mainland of China will be 86 763 (95% CI: 86 067-87 460) on May 2, 2020. Up until March 15, 2020, the case fatality rate increased to 6.42% (95% CI: 6.16-6.68%). On February 23, 2020, the existing confirmed cases reached its peak, with 60 890 cases (95% CI: 60 350-61 431). On January 23, 2020, the effective reproduction number was 2.620 (95% CI: 2.567-2.676) and had dropped below 1.0 since February 5, 2020. Due to governmental intervention, the total number of confirmed cases was reduced by 99.85% on May 2, 2020. Had the isolation been relaxed from February 24, 2020, there might have been a second peak of infection. However, relaxing the isolation after March 16, 2020 greatly reduced the number of existing confirmed cases and deaths. The total number of confirmed cases and deaths would increase by 8.72 and 9.44%, respectively, due to a 1-day delayed diagnosis in non-isolated infected patients. Moreover, if the coverage of close contact tracing was increased to 100%, the cumulative number of confirmed cases would be decreased by 88.26% on May 2, 2020. CONCLUSIONS: The quarantine measures adopted by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020 were necessary and effective. Postponing the relaxation of isolation, early diagnosis, patient isolation, broad close-contact tracing, and strict monitoring of infected persons could effectively control the COVID-19 epidemic. April 1, 2020 would be a reasonable date to lift quarantine in Hubei and Wuhan.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Factors Associated With Measles Transmission in the United States During the Postelimination Era\nIMPORTANCE: Measles cases and outbreaks continue to occur in the United States after the introduction of measles from endemic settings. OBJECTIVE: To discern the factors associated with measles transmission in the United States after measles had been eliminated. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study was conducted from January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2017, in the United States among US residents and international visitors with confirmed measles. A maximum likelihood algorithm that uses the observed dates of rash onset and the known distribution of the serial interval (time between symptom onset in related consecutive cases) was applied to outbreak notification data to estimate the effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of new infections generated per case. Transmissibility was assessed by comparing R based on the characteristics of primary and secondary cases of measles. EXPOSURES: Measles virus. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Effective reproduction number (R), or the mean number of successful transmission events per case of measles (ie, the mean number of persons to whom each patient with measles spreads measles). RESULTS: A total of 2218 individuals with confirmed measles cases (1025 female, 1176 male, and 17 sex not reported; median age, 15 years [range, 0-89 years]) reported from 2001 to 2017 were evaluated. Among patients who received no doses of measles vaccine, R was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.71-0.81); among patients who received 1 dose of measles vaccine, R was 0.17 (95% CI, 0.11-0.26); among patients who received 2 doses or more of measles vaccine, R was 0.27 (95% CI, 0.17-0.39); and among patients with unknown vaccination status, R was 0.52 (95% CI, 0.44-0.60). Among patients born before 1957, R was 0.35 (95% CI, 0.20-0.58), and among those born on or after 1957, R was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.61-0.68). R was higher when primary and secondary cases of measles were patients aged 5 to 17 years (0.36 [95% CI, 0.31-0.42]) compared with assortative transmission in other age groups (<1 year, 0.14 [95% CI, 0.10-0.20]; 1-4 years, 0.25 [95% CI, 0.20-0.30]; 18-29 years, 0.19 [95% CI, 0.15-0.24]; 30-49 years, 0.15 [95% CI, 0.11-0.20]; \u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a550 years, 0.04 [95% CI, 0.01-0.10]).

Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R0, for that model. Applying the R_0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R_0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a tunneling effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.

It is found that the spread of COVID-19 has been significantly slowing down within the two weeks from January 27 to February 10th with 87.0% and 84.3% reductions in the reproduction number R0 among the 30 provinces and 15 Hubei cities, respectively. This suggests the extreme control measures implemented since January 23, which include cutting off Wuhan and many other cities and towns, a great public awareness and high level of self isolation at home, have contributed to a substantial decline in the reproductivity of the COVID-19 in China. We predict that Hubei province will reach its peak between February 20 and 22, 2020, and if the removal rate can be increased to 0.1, the epidemic outside Hubei province will end in May 2020, and inside Hubei in early June.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Estimation of country-level basic reproductive ratios for novel Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19) using synthetic contact matrices\nThe 2019-2020 pandemic of atypical pneumonia (COVID-19) caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread globally and has the potential to infect large numbers of people in every country. Estimating the country-specific basic reproductive ratio is a vital first step in public-health planning. The basic reproductive ratio (R(0)) is determined by both the nature of pathogen and the network of human contacts through which the disease can spread, which is itself dependent on population age structure and household composition. Here we introduce a transmission model combining age-stratified contact frequencies with age-dependent susceptibility, probability of clinical symptoms, and transmission from asymptomatic (or mild) cases, which we use to estimate the country-specific basic reproductive ratio of COVID-19 for 152 countries. Using early outbreak data from China and a synthetic contact matrix, we estimate an age-stratified transmission structure which can then be extrapolated to 151 other countries for which synthetic contact matrices also exist. This defines a set of country-specific transmission structures from which we can calculate the basic reproductive ratio for each country. Our predicted R(0) is critically sensitive to the intensity of transmission from asymptomatic cases; with low asymptomatic transmission the highest values are predicted across Eastern Europe and Japan and the lowest across Africa, Central America and South-Western Asia. This pattern is largely driven by the ratio of children to older adults in each country and the observed propensity of clinical cases in the elderly. If asymptomatic cases have comparable transmission to detected cases, the pattern is reversed. Our results demonstrate the importance of age-specific heterogeneities going beyond contact structure to the spread of COVID-19. These heterogeneities give COVID-19 the capacity to spread particularly quickly in countries with older populations, and that intensive control measures are likely to be necessary to impede its progress in these countries.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Bidirectional contact tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control\nContact tracing is critical to controlling COVID-19, but most protocols only \"forward-trace\" to notify people who were recently exposed. Using a stochastic branching-process model, we find that \"bidirectional\" tracing to identify infector individuals and their other infectees robustly improves outbreak control. In our model, bidirectional tracing more than doubles the reduction in effective reproduction number (Reff) achieved by forward-tracing alone, while dramatically increasing resilience to low case ascertainment and test sensitivity. The greatest gains are realised by expanding the manual tracing window from 2 to 6 days pre-symptom-onset or, alternatively, by implementing high-uptake smartphone-based exposure notification; however, to achieve the performance of the former approach, the latter requires nearly all smartphones to detect exposure events. With or without exposure notification, our results suggest that implementing bidirectional tracing could dramatically improve COVID-19 control.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: COVID-19 UK Lockdown Forecasts and R0\nIntroduction The first reported UK case of COVID-19 occurred on 31 January 2020, and a lockdown of unknown duration began on 24 March. One model to forecast disease spread depends on clinical parameters and transmission rates. Output includes the basic reproduction number R0 and the log growth rate r in the exponential phase. Methods UK data on reported deaths is used to estimate r. A likelihood for the transmission parameters is defined from a gaussian density for r using the mean and standard error of the estimate. Parameter samples from the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm lead to an estimate and credible interval for R0 and forecasts for severe and critical cases, and deaths during a lockdown. Results In the exponential phase, the UK growth rate for log(deaths) is r = 0.224 with s.e. 0.005. R0 = 5.81 with 90% CI (5.08 , 6.98). In a 12 week lockdown from 24 March with transmission parameters reduced to 20% of their previous values, around 63,000 severely ill patients will need hospitalisation by mid June, 37,000 critically ill will need intensive care, whilst over 81,000 are expected to die. Had the lockdown begun on 17 March around 16,500 severe, 9,250 critical cases and 18,500 deaths would be expected by early June. With 10% transmission, severe and critical cases peak in April. Discussion The R0 estimate is around twice the value quoted by the UK government. The NHS faces extreme pressures, even if transmission is reduced ten-fold.

Understanding the effect of control effort is crucial to inform future control strategies. OBJECTIVES: We developed a framework to measure season-based health burden risk from 2001 to 2014. We reconstructed various intervention coverage to assess the attributable effect of dengue infection control efforts.

We used disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to assess health burden risk. A temperature-basic reproduction number (R(0))\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153DALYs relationship was constructed to examine the potential impacts of temperature on health burden. Finally, a health burden risk model linked a control measure model to evaluate the effect of dengue control interventions. RESULTS: We showed that R(0) and DALYs peaked at 25\u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1387, respectively. Results indicated that most dengue cases occurred in fall with estimated DALYs of 323 (267\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u0153379, 95% CI) at 50% risk probability. We found that repellent spray had by far the largest control effect with an effectiveness of ~71% in all seasons. Pesticide spray and container clean-up have both made important contributions to reducing prevalence/incidence. Repellent, pesticide spray, container clean-up together with Wolbachia infection suppress dengue outbreak by ~90%.

It was the second largest MERS outbreak. As a result of the outbreak in South Korea, 186 infections were reported, and 36 patients died. At least 16,693 people were isolated with suspicious symptoms. This paper estimates the basic reproduction number of the MERS coronavirus (CoV), using data on the spread of MERS in South Korea. METHODS: The basic reproduction number of an epidemic is defined as the average number of secondary cases that an infected subject produces over its infectious period in a susceptible and uninfected population. To estimate the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV, we employ data from the 2015 South Korea MERS outbreak and the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, a mathematical model that uses a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RESULTS: We fit the model to the epidemic data of the South Korea outbreak minimizing the sum of the squared errors to identify model parameters. Also we derive the basic reproductive number as the terms of the parameters of the SIR model. Then we determine the basic reproduction number of the MERS-CoV in South Korea in 2015 as 8.0977. It is worth comparing with the basic reproductive number of the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa including Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, which had values of 1.5\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.5. CONCLUSIONS: There was no intervention to control the infection in the early phase of the outbreak, thus the data used here provide the best conditions to evaluate the epidemic characteristics of MERS, such as the basic reproduction number. An evaluation of basic reproduction number using epidemic data could be problematic if there are stochastic fluctuations in the early phase of the outbreak, or if the report is not accurate and there is bias in the data. Such problems are not relevant to this study because the data used here were precisely reported and verified by Korea Hospital Association.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Clustering of Countries for COVID-19 Cases based on Disease Prevalence, Health Systems and Environmental Indicators\nThe coronavirus has a high basic reproduction number (R0) and has caused the global COVID-19 pandemic. Governments are implementing lockdowns that are leading to economic fallout in many countries. Policy makers can take better decisions if provided with the indicators connected with the disease spread. This study is aimed to cluster the countries using social, economic, health and environmental related metrics affecting the disease spread so as to implement the policies to control the widespread of disease. Thus, countries with similar factors can take proactive steps to fight against the pandemic. The data is acquired for 79 countries and 18 different feature variables (the factors that are associated with COVID-19 spread) are selected. Pearson Product Moment Correlation Analysis is performed between all the feature variables with cumulative death cases and cumulative confirmed cases individually to get an insight of relation of these factors with the spread of COVID-19. Unsupervised k-means algorithm is used and the feature set includes economic, environmental indicators and disease prevalence along with COVID-19 variables. The learning model is able to group the countries into 4 clusters on the basis of relation with all 18 feature variables. We also present an analysis of correlation between the selected feature variables, and COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths. Prevalence of underlying diseases shows strong correlation with COVID-19 whereas environmental health indicators are weakly correlated with COVID-19.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Effective vaccine allocation strategies, balancing economy with infection control against COVID-19 in Japan\nDue to COVID-19, many countries including Japan have implemented a suspension of economic activities for infection control. It has contributed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 but caused severe economic losses. Today, several promising vaccines have been developed and are already being distributed in some countries. Therefore, we evaluated various vaccine and intensive countermeasure strategies with constraint of economic loss using SEIR model to obtain knowledge of how to balance economy with infection control in Japan. Our main results were that the vaccination strategy that prioritized younger generation was better in terms of deaths when a linear relationship between lockdown intensity and acceptable economic loss was assumed. On the other hand, when a non-linearity relationship was introduced, implying that the strong lockdown with small economic loss was possible, the old first strategies were best in the settings of small basic reproduction number. These results indicated a high potential of remote work when prioritizing vaccination for the old generation. When focusing on only the old first strategies as the Japanese government has decided to do, the strategy vaccinating the young next to the old was superior to the others when a non-linear relationship was assumed due to sufficient reduction of contact with small economic loss.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Challenges in Tracking the Risk of COVID-19 in Bangladesh: Evaluation of A Novel Method\nIdentifying actual risk zones in a country where the overall test positive rate (TPR) is higher than 5% is crucial to contain the pandemic. However, TPR-based risk zoning methods are debatable since they do not consider the rate of infection in an area and thus, it has been observed to overestimate the risk. Similarly, the rate of infection in an area has been noticed to underestimate the risk of COVID-19 spreading for the zones with higher TPR. In this article, we discuss the shortcomings of currently available risk zoning methods that are followed in the lower-middle-income countries (LMIC), especially in Bangladesh. We then propose to determine a risk zone by combining the rate of infection with TPR and effective reproduction number, Rt in a distinct manner from existing methods. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed method with respect to the mass-movement events and show its application to track the evolution of COVID-19 pandemic by identifying the risk zones over time.

The disease has spread to 210 countries and has been labelled as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). Modelling, evaluating, and predicting the rate of disease transmission is crucial in understanding optimal methods for prevention and control. Our aim is to assess the impact of interstate and foreign travel and public health interventions implemented by the United States government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model was developed to study transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. A system of nonlinear differential equations was formulated and the basic reproduction number R 0 was computed. Stability of the model was evaluated at the equilibrium points. Optimal controls were applied in the form of travel restrictions and quarantine. Numerical simulations were conducted. Results: Analysis shows that the model is locally asymptomatically stable, at endemic and foreigners free equilibrium points. Without any mitigation measures, infectivity and subsequent hospitalization of the population increased. When interstate and foreign travel was restricted and the population placed under quarantine, the probability of exposure and subsequent infection decreased significantly; furthermore, the recovery rate increased substantially. Conclusion: Interstate and foreign travel restrictions, in addition to quarantine, are necessary in effectively controlling the pandemic. The United States has controlled COVID-19 spread by implementing quarantine and restricting foreign travel.

METHODS: We enrolled 453 mechanically ventilated patients with acute respiratory failure (ARF) without invasive fungal infection and measured BDG, innate immunity, and epithelial permeability biomarkers in serially collected plasma samples. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, patients with ARF had significantly higher BDG levels (median [IQR], 26 pg/mL [15\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 pg/mL], P < 0.001), whereas patients with ARF with high BDG levels (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u20ac\u00b0\u00c2\u00a540 pg/mL, 31%) had higher odds for assignment to the prognostically adverse hyperinflammatory subphenotype (OR [CI], 2.88 [1.83\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01534.54], P < 0.001). Baseline BDG levels were predictive of fewer ventilator-free days and worse 30-day survival (adjusted P < 0.05). Integrative analyses of fungal colonization and epithelial barrier disruption suggested that BDG may translocate from either the lung or gut compartment. We validated the associations between plasma BDG and host inflammatory responses in 97 hospitalized patients with COVID-19. CONCLUSION: BDG measurements offered prognostic information in critically ill patients without fungal infections. Further research in the mechanisms of translocation and innate immunity recognition and stimulation may offer new therapeutic opportunities in critical illness.

The first case in Anhui, a province of China, was reported on January 10, 2020. In the field of infectious diseases, modeling, evaluating and predicting the rate of disease transmission is very important for epidemic prevention and control. Different intervention measures have been implemented starting from different time nodes in the country and Anhui, the epidemic may be divided into three stages for January 10 to February 11, 2020, namely. We adopted interrupted time series method and develop an SEI/QR model to analyse the data. Our results displayed that the lockdown of Wuhan implemented on January 23, 2020 reduced the contact rate of epidemic transmission in Anhui province by 48.37%, and centralized quarantine management policy for close contacts in Anhui reduced the contact rate by an additional 36.97%. At the same time, the estimated basic reproduction number gradually decreased from the initial 2.9764 to 0.8667 and then to 0.5725. We conclude that the Wuhan lockdown and the centralized quarantine management policy in Anhui played a crucial role in the timely and effective mitigation of the epidemic in Anhui. One merit of this work is the adoption of morbidity data which may reflect the epidemic more accurately and promptly.

Method: This cross-sectional descriptive study was performed on all people with COVID-19 from the first date of admission of positive PCR patients with SARS-CoV-2 until September 21, 2020, in the area of Markazi Province in Khomein, Iran. Information on the records of definitively discharged and deceased patients due to COVID-19 (having positive PCR) was extracted from 20/2/2020 to 21/9/2020, and Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19 were evaluated. The sample size was 691 people. Results: The CFR of the COVID-19 in the current study is 6.65%, and the rate of disease transmission among the sensitive population of Khomein city at the beginning of the study (March) averaged BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.75, and in the last month (September) of the study This value was reduced to BASIC REPRODUCTIVE RATE= 1.306. Conclusion: According to our study on Case Fatality Rate (CFR) and Basic Reproductive Rate (R-naught) of COVID-19, showed that the prevalence of the disease was high in March, which due to lack of proper observance of health protocols, we saw this problem and in the months when people have more problems.

METHODS: Using national surveillance data including demographics, laboratory test data, clinical presentation, risk exposures (travel history, contacts and occupation) and outcomes of persons undergoing COVID-19 testing or hospitalised with COVID-19 at sentinel surveillance sites, we generated and interpreted descriptive statistics, epidemic curves, and initial reproductive numbers (Rt). FINDINGS: From 4 March to 30 April 2020, 271,670 SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests were performed (462 tests/100,000 persons). Of these, 7,892 (2.9%) persons tested positive (median age 37 years (interquartile range 28\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u015349 years), 4,568 (58%) male, cumulative incidence of 13.4 cases/100,000 persons). Hospitalization records were found for 1,271 patients (692 females (54%)) of whom 186 (14.6%) died. Amongst 2,819 cases with data, 489/2819 (17.3%) travelled internationally within 14 days prior to diagnosis, mostly during March 2020 (466 (95%)). Cases diagnosed in April compared with March were younger (median age, 37 vs. 40 years), less likely female (38% vs. 53%) and resident in a more populous province (98% vs. 91%). The national initial R(t) was 2.08 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.71\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01532.51).

This study's aim is to identify the causes that led to this exponential rise in the accumulation of confirmed cases. METHODS: Epidemiological investigation reports were used to reconstruct chains of transmission as well as assess the net contribution of local infections relative to imported cases, infected travelers arriving from abroad. A mathematical model was implemented in order to describe the efficiency of the quarantine-isolation policy and the inflow of imported cases. The model's simulations included two scenarios for the actual time series of the symptomatic cases, providing insights into the conditions that lead to the abrupt change. RESULTS: The abrupt change followed a Jewish holiday, Purim, in which many public gatherings were held. According to the first scenario, the accumulation of confirmed cases before Purim was driven by imported cases resulting in a controlled regime, with an effective reproduction number, Re, of 0.69. In the second scenario, which followed Purim, a continuous rise of the local to imported cases ratio began, which led to an exponential growth regime characterized by an Re of 4.34. It was found that the change of regime cannot be attributed to super-spreader events, as these consisted of approximately 5% of the primary cases, which resulted in 17% of the secondary cases.

Their accuracy is unknown, which could affect downstream analyses. Objective: To compare the performance of fever-, cough-, and dyspnea-specific ICD-10 codes with medical record review among patients tested for COVID-19. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study included patients who underwent quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction testing for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 at University of Utah Health from March 10 to April 6, 2020. Data analysis was performed in April 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of ICD-10 codes for fever (R50*), cough (R05*), and dyspnea (R06.0*) were compared with manual medical record review. Performance was calculated overall and stratified by COVID-19 test result, sex, age group (<50, 50-64, and >64 years), and inpatient status. Bootstrapping was used to generate 95% CIs, and Pearson &#967;2 tests were used to compare different subgroups. Results: Among 2201 patients tested for COVD-19, the mean (SD) age was 42 (17) years; 1201 (55%) were female, 1569 (71%) were White, and 282 (13%) were Hispanic or Latino. The prevalence of fever was 66% (1444 patients), that of cough was 88% (1930 patients), and that of dyspnea was 64% (1399 patients). For fever, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.26 (95% CI, 0.24-0.29), specificity was 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-0.99), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97), and NPV was 0.41 (95% CI, 0.39-0.43). For cough, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.44 (95% CI, 0.42-0.46), specificity was 0.88 (95% CI, 0.84-0.92), PPV was 0.96 (95% CI, 0.95-0.97), and NPV was 0.18 (95% CI, 0.16-0.20). For dyspnea, the sensitivity of ICD-10 codes was 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22-0.26), specificity was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.96-0.98), PPV was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.90-0.96), and NPV was 0.42 (95% CI, 0.40-0.44). ICD-10 code performance was better for inpatients than for outpatients for fever (&#967;2 = 41.30; P < .001) and dyspnea (&#967;2 = 14.25; P = .003) but not for cough (&#967;2 = 5.13; P = .16). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that ICD-10 codes lack sensitivity and have poor NPV for symptoms associated with COVID-19. This inaccuracy has implications for any downstream data model, scientific discovery, or surveillance that relies on these codes.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Early effects of ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome: a prospective observational study\nBACKGROUND: In COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the effectiveness of ventilatory rescue strategies remains uncertain, with controversial efficacy on systemic oxygenation and no data available regarding cerebral oxygenation and hemodynamics. METHODS: This is a prospective observational study conducted at San Martino Policlinico Hospital, Genoa, Italy. We included adult COVID-19 patients who underwent at least one of the following rescue therapies: recruitment maneuvers (RMs), prone positioning (PP), inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), and extracorporeal carbon dioxide (CO2) removal (ECCO2R). Arterial blood gas values (oxygen saturation [SpO2], partial pressure of oxygen [PaO2] and of carbon dioxide [PaCO2]) and cerebral oxygenation (rSO2) were analyzed before (T0) and after (T1) the use of any of the aforementioned rescue therapies. The primary aim was to assess the early effects of different ventilatory rescue therapies on systemic and cerebral oxygenation. The secondary aim was to evaluate the correlation between systemic and cerebral oxygenation in COVID-19 patients. RESULTS: Forty-five rescue therapies were performed in 22 patients. The median [interquartile range] age of the population was 62 [57-69] years, and 18/22 [82%] were male. After RMs, no significant changes were observed in systemic PaO2 and PaCO2 values, but cerebral oxygenation decreased significantly (52 [51-54]% vs. 49 [47-50]%, p < 0.001). After PP, a significant increase was observed in PaO2 (from 62 [56-71] to 82 [76-87] mmHg, p = 0.005) and rSO2 (from 53 [52-54]% to 60 [59-64]%, p = 0.005). The use of iNO increased PaO2 (from 65 [67-73] to 72 [67-73] mmHg, p = 0.015) and rSO2 (from 53 [51-56]% to 57 [55-59]%, p = 0.007). The use of ECCO2R decreased PaO2 (from 75 [75-79] to 64 [60-70] mmHg, p = 0.009), with reduction of rSO2 values (59 [56-65]% vs. 56 [53-62]%, p = 0.002). In the whole population, a significant relationship was found between SpO2 and rSO2 (R = 0.62, p < 0.001) and between PaO2 and rSO2 (R0 0.54, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Rescue therapies exert specific pathophysiological mechanisms, resulting in different effects on systemic and cerebral oxygenation in critically ill COVID-19 patients with ARDS. Cerebral and systemic oxygenation are correlated. The choice of rescue strategy to be adopted should take into account both lung and brain needs.

Methods: We developed a stochastic dynamic transmission model of COVID-19 in one large urban U.S. jail among staff and incarcerated individuals. We divided the outbreak into four intervention phases: the start of the outbreak, depopulation of the jail, increased proportion of people in single cells, and asymptomatic testing. We used the next generation method to estimate the basic reproduction ratio, R0, in each phase. We estimated the fraction of new cases, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by these interventions along with the standard measures of sanitization, masking, and social distancing interventions. Results: For the first outbreak phase, the estimated R0 was 8.23 (95% CrI: 5.01-12.90), and for the subsequent phases, R0, phase 2 = 3.58 (95% CrI: 2.46-5.08), R0, phase 3 = 1.72 (95% CrI: 1.41-2.12), and R0, phase 4 = 0.45 (95% CrI: 0.32-0.59). In total, the jail's interventions prevented approximately 83% of projected cases and hospitalizations and 89% of deaths over 83 days. Conclusions: Depopulation, single celling, and asymptomatic testing within jails can be effective strategies to mitigate COVID-19 transmission in addition to standard public health measures. Policy Implications: Decision-makers should prioritize reductions in the jail population, single celling, and testing asymptomatic populations, as additional measures to manage COVID-19 within correctional settings.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: The role of directionality, heterogeneity and correlations in epidemic risk and spread\nMost models of epidemic spread, including many designed specifically for COVID-19, implicitly assume that social networks are undirected, i.e., that the infection is equally likely to spread in either direction whenever a contact occurs. In particular, this assumption implies that the individuals most likely to spread the disease are also the most likely to receive it from others. Here, we review results from the theory of random directed graphs which show that many important quantities, including the reproductive number and the epidemic size, depend sensitively on the joint distribution of in- and out-degrees (\"risk\" and \"spread\"), including their heterogeneity and the correlation between them. By considering joint distributions of various kinds we elucidate why some types of heterogeneity cause a deviation from the standard Kermack-McKendrick analysis of SIR models, i.e., so called mass-action models where contacts are homogeneous and random, and some do not. We also show that some structured SIR models informed by complex contact patterns among types of individuals (age or activity) are simply mixtures of Poisson processes and tend not to deviate significantly from the simplest mass-action model. Finally, we point out some possible policy implications of this directed structure, both for contact tracing strategy and for interventions designed to prevent superspreading events. In particular, directed networks have a forward and backward version of the classic \"friendship paradox\" -- forward links tend to lead to individuals with high risk, while backward links lead to individuals with high spread -- such that a combination of both forward and backward contact tracing is necessary to find superspreading events and prevent future cascades of infection.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Self-Organizing, Symmetry Breaking, Isogenic Human Lung Buds on Microchips Identify Alveolar Stem Cells as Novel Targets of SARS-CoV-2\nAlthough lung disease is the primary clinical outcome in COVID-19 patients, how SARS-CoV-2 induces lung pathology remains elusive. Here we describe a high-throughput platform to generate self-organizing, nearly identical, and genetically-matched human lung buds derived from hESCs cultured on micropatterned substrates. Synthetic lung buds resemble human fetal lungs and display proximo-distal patterning of alveolar and airway tissue directed by KGF. They are susceptible to infection by SARS-CoV-2 and endemic coronaviruses and can be used to track cell type-specific cytopathic effects in hundreds of lung buds in parallel. We detected an increased susceptibility to infection in alveolar cells and identified cycling alveolar stem cells as new targets of SARS-CoV-2. We used this platform to test neutralizing antibodies that efficiently blocked SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission. Synthetic lung buds offer unlimited, rapid and scalable access to disease-relevant tissue that recapitulates human lung morphogenesis to identify key vulnerabilities for COVID-19 and respiratory viruses.Funding: This work was supported by the Pershing Square Foundation, NIH grants P01AI138398-S1, 2U19AI111825, and R01AI091707-10S1, a George Mason University Fast Grant, the BAWD Foundation, the G.

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review to estimate secondary attack rates (SAR) and observed reproduction numbers (Robs) in different settings exploring differences by age, symptom status, and duration of exposure. To account for additional study heterogeneity, we employed a Beta-Binomial model to pool SARs across studies and a Negative-binomial model to estimate Robs. RESULTS: Households showed the highest transmission rates, with a pooled SAR of 21.1% (95%CI:17.4%-24.8%). SARs were significantly higher where the duration of household exposure exceeded 5 days compared with exposure of &#8804;5 days. SARs related to contacts at social events with family and friends were higher than those for low-risk casual contacts (5.9% vs. 1.2%). Estimates of SAR and Robs for asymptomatic index cases were approximately a seventh, and for pre-symptomatic two thirds of those for symptomatic index cases. We found some evidence for reduced transmission potential both from and to individuals under 20 years of age in the household context, which is more limited when examining all settings. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that exposure in settings with familiar contacts increases SARS-CoV-2 transmission potential. Additionally, the differences observed in transmissibility by index case symptom status and duration of exposure have important implications for control strategies such as contact tracing, testing and rapid isolation of cases. There was limited data to explore transmission patterns in workplaces, schools, and care-homes, highlighting the need for further research in such settings.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Population Mobility Driven COVID-19 Analysis in Shenzhen\nIn the beginning of 2020, the COVID-19 epidemic broke out and spread all over the world in just a few months. COVID-19 spread analysis has attracted considerable research efforts in many areas including the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. However, most studies do not use real data on population mobility, or choose an overly wide range of objects. This paper studies the COVID-19 epidemic in Shenzhen from January 26 to February 16, focusing on the impact of population mobility on the epidemic development. Combined with the population mobility data, we propose the Source-SEIR model. We estimated that the basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 is 2.61. The experiment results show that the combination of population mobility data is helpful to the evaluation of the epidemic development, and the restrictions on population mobility in Shenzhen have played a role in curbing the deterioration of COVID-19 epidemic. Without restrictions on population mobility, there will be more than 600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Shenzhen. ?\u00a9 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Characterizing the Transmission Potential of Zoonotic Infections from Minor Outbreaks\nThe transmission potential of a novel infection depends on both the inherent transmissibility of a pathogen, and the level of susceptibility in the host population. However, distinguishing between these pathogen- and population-specific properties typically requires detailed serological studies, which are rarely available in the early stages of an outbreak. Using a simple transmission model that incorporates age-stratified social mixing patterns, we present a novel method for characterizing the transmission potential of subcritical infections, which have effective reproduction number R<1, from readily available data on the size of outbreaks. We show that the model can identify the extent to which outbreaks are driven by inherent pathogen transmissibility and pre-existing population immunity, and can generate unbiased estimates of the effective reproduction number. Applying the method to real-life infections, we obtained accurate estimates for the degree of age-specific immunity against monkeypox, influenza A(H5N1) and A(H7N9), and refined existing estimates of the reproduction number. Our results also suggest minimal pre-existing immunity to MERS-CoV in humans. The approach we describe can therefore provide crucial information about novel infections before serological surveys and other detailed analyses are available. The methods would also be applicable to data stratified by factors such as profession or location, which would make it possible to measure the transmission potential of emerging infections in a wide range of settings.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Dynamics of COVID-19 Epidemic Model with Asymptomatic Infection, Quarantine, Protection and Vaccination\nWe discuss the dynamics of new COVID-19 epidemic model by considering asymptomatic infections and the policies such as quarantine, protection (adherence to health protocols), and vaccination. The proposed model contains nine subpopulations: Susceptible (S), exposed (E), symptomatic infected (I), asymptomatic infected (A), recovered (R), death (D), protected (P), quarantined (Q), and vaccinated (V). We first show the non-negativity and boundedness of solutions. The equilibrium points, basic reproduction number, and stability of equilibrium points, both locally and globally, are also investigated analytically. The proposed model has disease-free equilibrium point and endemic equilibrium point. The disease-free equilibrium point always exists and is globally asymptotically stable if basic reproduction number is less than one. The endemic equilibrium point exists uniquely and is globally asymptotically stable if the basic reproduction number is greater than one. These properties have been confirmed by numerical simulations using the fourth order Runge-Kutta method. Numerical simulations show that the disease transmission rate of asymptomatic infection, quarantine rates, protection rate, and vaccination rates affect the basic reproduction number and hence also influence the stability of equilibrium points. \u00c3\u201a\u00c2\u00a9 2021 Published by Indonesian Biomathematical Society.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Aligning SARS-CoV-2 indicators via an epidemic model: application to hospital admissions and RNA detection in sewage sludge\nAscertaining the state of coronavirus outbreaks is crucial for public health decision-making. Absent repeated representative viral test samples in the population, public health officials and researchers alike have relied on lagging indicators of infection to make inferences about the direction of the outbreak and attendant policy decisions. Recently researchers have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in municipal sewage sludge with measured RNA concentrations rising and falling suggestively in the shape of an epidemic curve while providing an earlier signal of infection than hospital admissions data. The present paper presents a SARS-CoV-2 epidemic model to serve as a basis for estimating the incidence of infection, and shows mathematically how modeled transmission dynamics translate into infection indicators by incorporating probability distributions for indicator-specific time lags from infection. Hospital admissions and SARS-CoV-2 RNA in municipal sewage sludge are simultaneously modeled via maximum likelihood scaling to the underlying transmission model.

Using the incidence data of COVID-19, we estimate the reproduction number at 1.5 (95% CI: 1.4-1.6), which indicates sustained transmission and support the implementation of social distancing measures to rapidly control the outbreak.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Global COVID-19 pandemic waves: Limited lessons learned worldwide over the past year\nThe occurrence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was followed by a small burst of cases around the world; afterward, due to a series of emergency non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), the increasing number of confirmed cases slowed down in many countries. However, the subsequent gradual easing of governance led to a sudden increase in cases in late July 2020, arousing deep concern across the globe. This study evaluates the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in countries and territories worldwide from January 2020 to February 2021. According to the time-varying reproduction number (R(t)) of each country or territory, the results show that almost half of the countries and territories in the world have never controlled the epidemic. Among the countries and territories that had once contained the occurrence, nearly half failed to maintain their prevention and control, causing the COVID-19 pandemic to rebound across the world\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u009dresulting in even higher waves in half of the rebounding countries or territories. This work also proposes and uses a time-varying country-level transmission risk score (CTRS), which takes into account both R(t) and daily new cases, to demonstrate country-level or territory-level transmission potential and trends. Time-varying hierarchical clustering of time-varying CTRS values was used to successfully reveal the countries and territories that contributed to the recent aggravation of the global pandemic in the last quarter of 2020 and the beginning of 2021, and to identify countries and territories with an increasing risk of COVID-19 transmission in the near future. Furthermore, a regression analysis indicated that the introduction and relaxation of NPIs, including workplace closure policies and stay-at-home requirements, appear to be associated with recent global transmission changes. In conclusion, a systematic evaluation of the global COVID-19 pandemic over the past year indicates that the world is now in an unexpected situation, with limited lessons learned. Summarizing the lessons learned could help in designing effective public responses for constraining future waves of COVID-19 worldwide.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: The introduction of population migration to SEIAR for COVID-19 epidemic modelling with an efficient intervention strategy\nIn this paper, we present a mathematical model of an infectious disease according to the characteristics of the COVID-19 pandemic. The proposed enhanced model, which will be referred to as the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered) model with population migration, is inspired by the role that asymptomatic infected individuals, as well as population movements can play a crucial role in spreading the virus. In the model, the infected and the basic reproduction numbers are compared under the influence of intervention policies.

Methods: We fit logistic growth curves to reported daily case numbers, up to the first epidemic peak. This fitting estimates R0. We then use a generalized additive model to discern the effects, and include 5 random effect covariates to account for potential differences in testing and reporting that can bias the estimated R0. Findings: We found that the mean R0 is 1.70 (S.D. 0.57), with a range between 1.10 (Ghana) and 3.52 (South Korea). We identified four factors- population between 20-34 years old (youth), population residing in urban agglomerates over 1 million (city), social media use to organize offline action (social media), and GINI income inequality- as having strong relationships with R0. An intermediate level of youth and GINI inequality are associated with high R0, while high city population and high social media use are associated with high R0. Environmental and climate factors were not found to have strong relationships with R0. Conclusion: Studies that aim to measure the effectiveness of interventions should account for the intrinsic differences between populations.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Global convergence of COVID-19 basic reproduction number and estimation from early-time SIR dynamics\nThe SIR (\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00cb\u0153susceptible-infectious-recovered\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2) formulation is used to uncover the generic spread mechanisms observed by COVID-19 dynamics globally, especially in the early phases of infectious spread. During this early period, potential controls were not effectively put in place or enforced in many countries. Hence, the early phases of COVID-19 spread in countries where controls were weak offer a unique perspective on the ensemble-behavior of COVID-19 basic reproduction number R(o) inferred from SIR formulation. The work here shows that there is global convergence (i.e., across many nations) to an uncontrolled R(o) = 4.5 that describes the early time spread of COVID-19. This value is in agreement with independent estimates from other sources reviewed here and adds to the growing consensus that the early estimate of R(o) = 2.2 adopted by the World Health Organization is low. A reconciliation between power-law and exponential growth predictions is also featured within the confines of the SIR formulation.

Model results indicate that if intervention measures still result in R(o) > 2.7 within 44 days after first infection, intervention is unlikely to be effective in general for COVID-19.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Assessing the impact of COVID-19 border restrictions on dengue transmission in Yunnan Province, China: an observational epidemiological and phylogenetic analysis\nBackground: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, China implemented strict restrictions on cross-border travel to prevent disease importation. Yunnan, a Chinese province that borders dengue-endemic countries in Southeast Asia, experienced unprecedented reduction in dengue, from 6840 recorded cases in 2019 to 260 in 2020. Methods: Using a combination of epidemiological and virus genomic data, collected from 2013 to 2020 in Yunnan and neighbouring countries, we conduct a series of analyses to characterise the role of virus importation in driving dengue dynamics in Yunnan and assess the association between recent international travel restrictions and the decline in dengue reported in Yunnan in 2020. Findings: We find strong evidence that dengue incidence between 2013-2019 in Yunnan was closely linked with international importation of cases. A 0-2 month lag in incidence not explained by seasonal differences, absence of local transmission in the winter, effective reproductive numbers < 1 (as estimated independently using genetic data) and diverse cosmopolitan dengue virus phylogenies all suggest dengue is non-endemic in Yunnan. Using a multivariate statistical model we show that the substantial decline in dengue incidence observed in Yunnan in 2020 but not in neighbouring countries is closely associated with the timing of international travel restrictions, even after accounting for other environmental drivers of dengue incidence. Interpretation: We conclude that Yunnan is a regional sink for DENV lineage movement and that border restrictions may have substantially reduced dengue burden in 2020, potentially averting thousands of cases. Targeted testing and surveillance of travelers returning from high-risk areas could help to inform public health strategies to minimise or even eliminate dengue outbreaks in non-endemic settings like southern China.

METHODS: We used SEIAR and SEIA-CQFH warehouse models to simulate the two-period epidemic in Wuhan and calculate the time dependent basic reproduction numbers (BRNs) of symptomatic infected individuals, asymptomatic infected individuals, exposed individuals, and community-isolated infected individuals. Scenarios that varied in terms of the maximum numbers of open beds in Fangcang shelter hospitals and designated hospitals, and the time intervals from illness onset to hospitals visit and diagnosis were considered to quantitatively assess the optimal measures. RESULTS: The BRN decreased from 4.50 on Jan 22, 2020 to 0.18 on March 18, 2020. Without Fangcang shelter hospitals, the cumulative numbers of cases and deaths would increase by 18.58 and 51.73%, respectively. If the number of beds in the designated hospitals decreased by 1/2 and 1/4, the number of cumulative cases would increase by 178.04 and 92.1%, respectively. If the time interval from illness onset to hospital visit was 4 days, the number of cumulative cases and deaths would increase by 2.79 and 6.19%, respectively. If Fangcang shelter hospitals were not established, the number of beds in designated hospitals reduced 1/4, and the time interval from visiting hospitals to diagnosis became 4 days, the cumulative number of cases would increase by 268.97%. CONCLUSION: The declining BRNs indicate the high effectiveness of the joint measures. The joint measures led by Fangcang shelter hospitals are crucial and need to be rolled out globally, especially when medical resources are limited.

Collective activity can be modified through imposed control measures, but spontaneous changes can also arise as a result of uncoordinated individual responses to the perceived risk of contagion. Here, we introduce a stochastic epidemic model implementing population responses driven by individual time-varying risk aversion. The model reveals an emergent mechanism for the generation of multiple infection waves of decreasing amplitude that progressively tune the effective reproduction number to its critical value R = 1. In successive waves, individuals with gradually lower risk propensity are infected. The overall mechanism shapes well-defined risk-aversion profiles over the whole population as the epidemic progresses. We conclude that uncoordinated changes in human behaviour can by themselves explain major qualitative and quantitative features of the epidemic process, like the emergence of multiple waves and the tendency to remain around R = 1 observed worldwide after the first few waves of COVID-19.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Linking key intervention timings to rapid declining effective reproduction number to quantify lessons against COVID-19\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently under a global pandemic trend. The efficiency of containment measures and epidemic tendency of typical countries should be assessed. In this study, the efficiency of prevention and control measures in China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, and Japan was assessed, and the COVID-19 epidemic tendency among these countries was compared. Results showed that the effective reproduction number(Re) in Wuhan, China increased almost exponentially, reaching a maximum of 3.98 before a lockdown and rapidly decreased to below 1 due to containment and mitigation strategies of the Chinese government. The Re in Italy declined at a slower pace than that in China after the implementation of prevention and control measures. The Re in Iran showed a certain decline after the establishment of a national epidemic control command, and an evident stationary phase occurred because the best window period for the prevention and control of the epidemic was missed. The epidemic in Japan and South Korea reoccurred several times with the Re fluctuating greatly. The epidemic has hardly rebounded in China due to the implementation of prevention and control strategies and the effective enforcement of policies. Other countries suffering from the epidemic could learn from the Chinese experience in containing COVID-19.

As new epicentres in Europe and America have arisen, of particular concern is the increased number of imported coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Africa, where the impact of the pandemic could be more severe. We aim to estimate the number of COVID-19 cases imported from 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to each African country, as well as the probability of reaching 10,000 infections in total by the end of March, April, and May following viral introduction. Methods We used the reported number of cases imported from the 12 major epicentres in Europe and America to Singapore, as well as flight data, to estimate the number of imported cases in each African country. Under the assumption that Singapore has detected all the imported cases, the estimates for Africa were thus conservative. We then propagated the uncertainty in the imported case count estimates to simulate the onward spread of the virus, until 10,000 infections are reached or the end of May, whichever is earlier. Specifically, 1,000 simulations were run separately under two scenarios, where the reproduction number under the stay-at-home order was assumed to be 1.5 and 1.0 respectively. Findings We estimated Morocco, Algeria, South Africa, Egypt, Tunisia, and Nigeria as having the largest number of COVID-19 cases imported from the 12 major epicentres. Based on our 1,000 simulation runs, Morocco and Algeria's estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was close to 100% under both scenarios. In particular, we identified countries with less than 100 cases in total reported by end of April whilst the estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the more optimistic scenario. Conclusion Our study highlights particular countries that are likely to reach (or have reached) 10,000 infections far earlier than the reported data suggest, calling for the prioritization of resources to mitigate the further spread of the epidemic.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Effects of media reporting on mitigating spread of COVID-19 in the early phase of the outbreak.\nThe 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is running rampantly in China and is swiftly spreading to other countries in the world, which causes a great concern on the global public health. The absence of specific therapeutic treatment or effective vaccine against COVID-19 call for other avenues of the prevention and control measures. Media reporting is thought to be effective to curb the spreading of an emergency disease in the early stage. Cross-correlation analysis based on our collected data demonstrated a strong correlation between media data and the infection case data. Thus we proposed a deterministic dynamical model to examine the interaction of the disease progression and the media reports and to investigate the effectiveness of media reporting on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The basic reproduction number was estimated as 5.3167 through parameterization of the model with the number of cumulative confirmed cases, the number of cumulative deaths and the daily number of media items. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak, enhancing the response rate of the media reporting to the severity of COVID-19, and enhancing the response rate of the public awareness to the media reports, both can bring forward the peak time and reduce the peak size of the infection significantly. These findings suggested that besides improving the medical levels, media coverage can be considered as an effective way to mitigate the disease spreading during the initial stage of an outbreak.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: 685 Sleep Latency, Pre and Peri-COVID-19 Experiences and PTSD Symptoms: Results from the NYU COVID-19 Mental Health Study\nINTRODUCTION: An effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been the decision to subject individuals residing in New York City to quarantine rules in order to reduce the spread of the virus. As might have been expected, restriction of usual daily activities would affect individuals\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u201e\u00a2 sleep-wake patterns. It is also known that exposure to traumatic experiences can also engender sleep disturbances, most notably in their ability to initiate sleep. This study investigated the associations between sleep onset latency (SOL), pre and peri-COVID-19 exposure and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among New Yorkers. METHODS: 541 individuals (female = 373(69%); mean age=40.9) were recruited during the summer and fall of 2020 in New York City to participate in the NYU-COVID-19 Mental Health Study. Participants provided sociodemographic data and were also asked to respond to the COVID-19 quarantine experiences, comprised of seven binary questions, the PTSD Checklist-PCL-5, and the Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index. Descriptive and linear regression analysis were performed to explore associations of scores on the COVID-19 quarantine experience with PTSD and sleep data. All analyses were performed using SPSS 25.0 RESULTS: Regression analyses revealed that SOL emerged as the strongest independent predictor of PTSD symptoms [B(t) = \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u2122.630(12.7); p < .001]; factors adjusted in the model included pre and peri-covid-19 factors such as age, sex, job type, and quarantine experience. Analyses assessing potential interaction effect revealed that quarantine experience did not affect the relationship between SOL and PTSD [B(t) = .086(.831); p = >.005]. The other sleep factors in the model did not yield significance. sleep duration had a weak correlation with quarantine, it was not found to be a predictor of PTSD. CONCLUSION: We observed that SOL was the most important determinant of PTSD symptoms among individuals exposed to COVID-19. This is consistent with other findings suggesting that a sizable proportion of individuals exposed to pandemics are likely to experience sleep disturbances. It is plausible that quarantine might lead to increased daytime naps, which may impact SOL. Further research is needed to better understand the association of SOL and PTSD as a result of Covid-19.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a multi-modal weight management curriculum on counseling skills for health behavior change. DESIGN: A pair-matched, group-randomized controlled trial (2015-2020) included students enrolled in eight U.S. medical schools randomized to receive either multi-modal weight management education (MME) or traditional weight management education (TE). SETTING/PARTICIPANTS: Students from the class of 2020 (N=1305) were asked to participate in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) focused on weight management counseling and complete pre and post surveys. A total of 70.1% of eligible students (N=915) completed the OSCE and 69.3% (N=904) completed both surveys. INTERVENTIONS: The MME implemented over three years included a web-based course, a role-play classroom exercise, a web-patient encounter with feedback, and an enhanced clerkship experience with preceptors trained in weight management counseling (WMC). Counseling focused on the 5As (Ask, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arrange) and patient-centeredness. MEASUREMENTS: The outcome was student 5As WMC skills assessed using an objective measure, an OSCE, scored using a behavior checklist, and a subjective measure, student self-reported skills for performing the 5As. RESULTS: Among MME students who completed two of three WMC components compared to those who completed none, exposure was significantly associated with higher OSCE scores and self-reported 5A skills. LIMITATIONS: Variability in medical schools requiring participation in the WMC curriculum. CONCLUSIONS: This trial revealed that medical students struggle with delivering weight management counseling to their patients who have overweight or obesity. Medical schools, though restrained in adding curricula, should incorporate should incorporate multiple WMC curricula components early in medical student education to provide knowledge and build confidence for supporting patients in developing individualized plans for weight management.

Serial intervals - the time between symptom onset in an infector and infectee - are fundamental, and help to define rates of transmission, estimates of reproductive numbers, and vaccination levels needed to prevent transmission. However, estimating the serial interval requires knowledge of individuals' contacts and exposures (who infected whom), which is typically obtained through resource-intensive contact tracing efforts. We develop an alternate framework that uses virus sequences to inform who infected whom and thereby estimate serial intervals. The advantages are many-fold: virus sequences are often routinely collected to support epidemiological investigations and to monitor viral evolution. The genomic approach offers high resolution and cluster-specific estimates of the serial interval that are comparable with those obtained from contact tracing data. Our approach does not require contact tracing data, and can be used in large populations and over a range of time periods. We apply our techniques to SARS-CoV-2 sequence data from the first two waves of COVID-19 in Victoria, Australia. We find that serial interval estimates vary between clusters, supporting the need to monitor this key parameter and use updated estimates in onward applications. Compared to an early published serial interval estimate, using cluster-specific serial intervals can cause estimates of the effective reproduction number Rt to vary by a factor of up to 2-3. We also find that serial intervals estimated in settings such as schools and meat processing/packing plants tend to be shorter than those estimated in healthcare facilities.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:", "Context: Transmission of Hand, Foot and Mouth Disease and Its Potential Driving Factors in Hong Kong\nHand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common childhood disease with substantial disease burden in Asia. Mixed results were reported on the associations between HFMD incidence and meteorological factors or school holidays, while limited studies focused on their association on transmissibility. We aimed to measure the transmissibility of HFMD and to examine its potential driving factors in Hong Kong. A likelihood-based procedure was used to estimate time-dependent effective reproduction number (R(t)) based on weekly number of HFMD-associated hospitalizations from 2010 to 2014. The associations of between-year effects, depletion of susceptibles, absolute humidity and school holidays with R(t) were examined using linear regression. R(t) usually started increasing between early spring and summer and peaked in April to May at around 1.1\u00c3\u00a2\u00e2\u201a\u00ac\u00e2\u20ac\u01531.2, followed by a slight rebound in autumn. Depletion of susceptibles and between-years effects explained most of the variances (19 and 13% respectively) in R(t). We found a negative association between depletion of susceptibles and R(t) (coefficients ranged from \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.14 to \u00c3\u00a2\u00cb\u2020\u00e2\u20ac\u21220.03 for different years), but the estimated effects of absolute humidity and school holidays were insignificant.

International comparisons are hampered by highly variable conditions under which epidemics spread and differences in the timing and scale of interventions. Cumulative COVID-19 morbidity and mortality are functions of both the rate of epidemic growth and the duration of uninhibited growth before interventions were implemented. Incomplete and sporadic testing during the early COVID-19 epidemic makes it difficult to identify how long SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in different places. SARS-CoV-2 genetic sequences can be analyzed to provide an estimate of both the time of epidemic origin and the rate of early epidemic growth in different settings. Methods: We carried out a phylogenetic analysis of more than 29,000 publicly available whole genome SARS-CoV-2 sequences from 57 locations to estimate the time that the epidemic originated in different places. These estimates were cross-referenced with dates of the most stringent interventions in each location as well as the number of cumulative COVID-19 deaths following maximum intervention. Phylodynamic methods were used to estimate the rate of early epidemic growth and proxy estimates of epidemic size. Findings: The time elapsed between epidemic origin and maximum intervention is strongly associated with different measures of epidemic severity and explains 46% of variance in numbers infected at time of maximum intervention. The reproduction number is independently associated with epidemic severity. In multivariable regression models, epidemic severity was not associated with census population size. The time elapsed between detection of initial COVID-19 cases to interventions was not associated with epidemic severity, indicating that many locations experienced long periods of cryptic transmission. Interpretation: Locations where strong non-pharmaceutical interventions were implemented earlier experienced much less severe COVID-19 morbidity and mortality during the period of study.\n\nQuestion: What are the values for the following properties of the basic reproduction number estimate (R0): disease name, location, date, R0 value, %CI values, and method?\n\nAnswer:"], "response": ["[{\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"COVID-19\", \"location\": \"Tokyo, Japan\", \"date\": \"February 27 to March 19\", \"R0 value\": \"1.267\", \"%CI values\": \"[1.214, 1.341]\", \"method\": \"simple susceptible-nfected-recovery model\"}}]", "[{\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"COVID-19\", \"location\": \"Hubei, China\", \"date\": \"10 to 22 January\", \"R0 value\": \"3.1571\", \"%CI values\": \"-\", \"method\": \"SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei ,fminsearch optimization method\"}}, {\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"COVID-19\", \"location\": \"Hubei, China\", \"date\": \"from 23 to 27 January\", \"R0 value\": \"2.0471\", \"%CI values\": \"-\", \"method\": \"SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei ,fminsearch optimization method\"}}, {\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"COVID-19\", \"location\": \"Hubei, China\", \"date\": \"From 28 January to 30 April\", \"R0 value\": \"1.5014\", \"%CI values\": \"-\", \"method\": \"SELIHR model based on the surveillance data of Hubei ,fminsearch optimization method\"}}]", "\"unanswerable\"", "\"unanswerable\"", "\"unanswerable\"", "\"unanswerable\"", "\"unanswerable\"", "[{\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"COVID-19\", \"location\": \"Tuscany,Italy\", \"date\": \"28 January to 31 March 2020\", \"R0 value\": \"2.50\", \"%CI values\": \"95% confidence interval (CI): 2.18-2.83\", \"method\": \"-\"}}, {\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"COVID-19\", \"location\": \"Lazio, Italy\", \"date\": \"28 January to 31 March 2020\", \"R0 value\": \"3.00\", \"%CI values\": \"95% CI: 2.68-3.33\", \"method\": \"-\"}}, {\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"COVID-19\", \"location\": \"Lombardy, Italy\", \"date\": \"28 January to 31 March 2020\", \"R0 value\": \"2.96\", \"%CI values\": \"-\", \"method\": \"-\"}}]", "[{\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"SARS-CoV-2 variant B.1.1.7\", \"location\": \"Switzerland\", \"date\": \"01.01.2021-17.01.2021\", \"R0 value\": \"1.28\", \"%CI values\": \"1.07-1.49\", \"method\": \"Estimate based on total number of confirmed cases and Viollier sequencing data.\"}}]", "\"unanswerable\"", "\"unanswerable\"", "\"unanswerable\"", "[{\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"SARS-CoV-2\", \"location\": \"Argentina\", \"date\": \"-\", \"R0 value\": \"-\", \"%CI values\": \"-\", \"method\": \"-\"}}]", "[{\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"2019-nCoV\", \"location\": \"a community outside China\", \"date\": \"-\", \"R0 value\": \"6.5\", \"%CI values\": \"-\", \"method\": \"Simulations using stochastic SEIR model\"}}]", "\"unanswerable\"", "\"unanswerable\"", "\"unanswerable\"", "[{\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"New SARS-CoV-2 Variants\", \"location\": \"-\", \"date\": \"-\", \"R0 value\": \"-\", \"%CI values\": \"-\", \"method\": \"Bayesian framework and phylo-dynamics analysis\"}}]", "[{\"contribution\": {\"disease name\": \"COVID-19\", \"location\": \"State of Georgia USA\", \"date\": \"March and early May 2020\", \"R0 value\": \"2.88\", \"%CI values\": \"(95% C.I.
